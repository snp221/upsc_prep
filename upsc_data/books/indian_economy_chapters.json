    "content": "INDIAN ECONOMY- BEFORE AND AFTER INDEPENDENCE To prepare for INDIAN ECONOMY for any competitive exam, aspirants have to know about the INDIAN ECONOMY- BEFORE AND AFTER INDEPENDENCE . It gives an idea of all the important topics for the IAS Exam and the Indian Economy syllabus (GS-III). Important INDIAN ECONOMY- BEFORE AND AFTER INDEPENDENCE terms are important from Indian Economy perspectives in the UPSC exam. IAS aspirants should thoroughly understand their meaning and application, as questions can be asked from this static portion of the IAS Syllabus in both the UPSC Prelims and the UPSC Mains exams. British Conquest on India and Its Impact on Indian Economy Pre-British Conquests: India had been conquered several times before the British conquest, but invaders like the Portuguese settled in India. Distinctive Impact of British Conquest: The differences of the British conquest lies in the fact that it led to the emergence of a new political and economic system whose interests were rooted in foreign soil and whose policies were guided solely by their own interest. British Economic Exploitation and Policy: The main motive of the Britishers was to exploit the Indian resources for their advantages. They shifted trade with the rest of the world. They established a developed system of railways, telegraphs and legal systems . Stagnation of Indian Economy: The British concentrated that the Indian economy, trade and commerce and industrialization should not flourish, and made it stagnant in the developmental process. Comparative Analysis: In 1600 , Indian GDP per capita was 60% of British GDP per capita. Indian GDP estimates from 1600 to 1871 are based on output and population data. During the 17th and 18th centuries , Indian per capita GDP decreased steadily but stabilized in the 19th century. As British growth surged in the mid-17th century, India fell further behind . The Great Divergence: The Great Divergence began partly due to India’s decline and partly due to British growth. Indian living standards declined in the 18th century and stagnated in the 19th century. History Of INDIAN ECONOMY: Pre-British Era and Colonial Impact (BEFORE 1947) Pre-Colonial Indian Economy: India had an independent economy before the advent of British rule. Indian Handicraft Industries: India was particularly well known for its handicraft industries in the fields of cotton and silk textiles, metal and precious stone works, etc. Aim of the British Colonial Rule in India: To reduce the country to being a feeder Indian economy for Great Britain’s own rapidly expanding modern industrial base. British Economic Policies: Concerned more with the protection and promotion of the economic interests of Britain than with the development of the Indian economy. Transformation of Indian Economy: A fundamental change in the structure of the Indian economy transformed India into a net supplier of raw materials and consumer of finished industrial products from Britain. Neglect of Economic Measurement: The colonial government never made any sincere attempt to estimate the national and per capita income of India. Notable Estimators: Dadabhai Naoroji (Poverty and Un-British Rule in India), William Digby, Findlay Shirras, V.K.R.V. Rao (considered very significant) and R.C. Desai. Indian Economy: Impact of British Rule on Agriculture and Challenges Faced Agrarian Economy: Indian economy under the British rule was fundamentally agrarian . A bout 85 percent of the country’s population lived mostly in villages and derived livelihood directly or indirectly from AGRICULTURE . Stagnated Agriculture Sector: Reason being over-crowded with involvement of maximum population leading to a very low agricultural productivity, in absolute terms. However, the sector experienced some growth due to the expansion of the aggregate area under cultivation. Land Settlement Systems: Regarding systems of land settlement, the profit accruing from the agriculture sector went to the zamindars instead of the cultivators, with no zamindars initiating the development of agriculture. Lack of Agricultural Inputs: Low levels of technology, lack of irrigation facilities and negligible use of fertilizers resulted in a dismal level of agricultural productivity and efficiency. Neglect of Agricultural Infrastructure Investment: India’s agriculture was starved of investment in terracing, flood-control, drainage and desalination of soil. Impact of Commercialisation on Indian Farmers: The commercialisation of agriculture could hardly help farmers in improving their economic condition as they were producing cash crops which were to be ultimately used by British industries back home. Partition of the Country : A sizeable portion of the undivided country’s highly irrigated and fertile land went to Pakistan leading to an adverse impact upon India’s output from the agriculture sector especially, Jute industry (the whole of the area went away to East Pakistan) Industrial Sector in Indian Economy: Challenges, Deindustrialization, and the Call for Modernization Lack of Industrial Development in India: Indian Economy could not develop a sound industrial base even while carrying the legacy of churning out the best handicraft stuff in the world – it declined rapidly and no corresponding modern industrial base was allowed to take its place. Policy of Systematic Deindustrialization: To reduce India to the status of a mere exporter of important raw materials for the upcoming modern industries in Britain. British Objective: To turn the Indian economy into a sprawling market for the finished products of those industries so that their continued expansion could be ensured to the maximum advantage of Britain. Impact of Handicraft Industry Decline: Decline of the indigenous handicraft industries created massive unemployment and rural distress in india. Cotton and Jute Textile Mills: These were mainly concentrated in the western parts of the country – Maharashtra and Gujarat (Indians). Slow Progress of Modern Industry: During the second half of the nineteenth century, modern industry began to take root in India but its progress remained very slow and stagnant. The iron and steel industries began to rise. Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was incorporated in 1907 . Other industries like sugar, cement, paper , etc. came up after the Second World War. Capital Goods Industry: Though necessary to help promote further industrialisation, this industry did not bloom. Underwhelming Growth Rate: Growth rate of the new industrial sector and its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remained dismal and piecemeal. Need for Increased Public Investment: The industrial sector thus, was left out crying for modernisation, diversification, capacity building and increased public investment. Limited Area of Operation of the Public Sector: I t remained confined only to the railways, power generation, communications, ports and some other departmental undertakings. The capital goods industry means industries that can produce machine tools, which are, in turn, used to produce articles for current consumption. Foreign Trade in Indian Economy: Historical Significance, British Monopoly, and Impact Historical Significance: India has been an important trading nation since ancient times. Impact of Restrictive Policies: Restrictive policies of commodity production, trade and tariff made India an exporter of primary products (raw silk, cotton, wool, sugar, indigo, jute etc.) and an importer of finished consumer goods (cotton, silk and woolen clothes and capital goods like light machinery) produced in the factories of Britain British Monopoly Control: Britain maintained a monopoly control over India’s exports and imports, leading to more than half of India’s foreign trade being restricted to Britain while the rest was allowed with a few other countries like China , Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Persia (Iran). Impact of Suez Canal Opening: The opening of the Suez Canal further intensified British control over India’s foreign trade. Acute Scarcity of Essential Commodities: Several essential commodities, such as food grains, clothes, kerosene etc. suffered acute scarcity in the domestic market. Utilization of Indian Revenue: The expenses incurred by an office, set up by the colonial government in Britain and expenses on war fought by the British government were accrued from revenue generated from the Indian Economy. DEMOGRAPHIC TREND First documentation of the population of British India was conducted through the 1881 (decennial) census . This census revealed the unevenness in India’s population growth. India’s stages of demographic transition: The year 1921 is called the Big Divide. 1st Stage : Before 1921 2nd Stage : After 1921, neither the total population of India nor the rate of population growth at this stage was very high and the various social development indicators were also not quite encouraging. Overall Literacy Level: less than 16 per cent; (the female literacy level was at about seven per cent) Public Health Facilities : either unavailable to the larger population or, when available, were grossly inadequate. High Mortality Rates: Rampant occurrence of water and air-borne diseases taking a huge toll on life The overall mortality rate was very high and the infant mortality rate was quite alarming – about 218:1000 Life Expectancy: It was also very low – 32 years Extensive Poverty: prevailed in India during the colonial period which contributed to the worsening profile of India’s population of the time. OCCUPATIONAL STRUCTURE Definition: Occupational structure connotes the distribution of working persons across different industries and sectors Stagnation: Very little signs of changes in occupational structure witnessed during the colonial Dominance of Agriculture: Largest share of the workforce is about 70-75 per cent witnessed in agriculture . Minimal Growth in Manufacturing and the Services Sectors: accounted for only 10 and 15-20 per cent growth in regional variation respectively. Regional Variations: The parts of the then Madras Presidency , Maharashtra and West Bengal witnessed a decline in the dependence of the workforce on the agricultural sector with a commensurate increase in the manufacturing and the services sectors Orissa, Rajasthan and Punjab experienced an increase in the share of workforce in agriculture during the same time. Indian Economy and Infrastructure: Colonial Development and Its Economic Implications Colonial Infrastructure Development in India: To sub-serve various colonial interests (not to provide basic amenities to the people), development of basic infrastructure (railways, ports, water transport, posts and telegraphs) took place in India. Roads: To mobilize the army within Indian Economy To draw out raw materials from the countryside to the nearest railway station or to the ports to send these to far away England To reach out to the rural areas during the rainy season. Railways: Introduced in 1850s by Lord Dalhousie Enabled people to undertake long-distance travel, thereby breaking geographical and cultural barriers facilitated commercialisation of Indian agriculture, which adversely affected the comparative self-sufficiency of the village economies in India volume of India’s export trade expanded, with benefits rarely accruing to the Indian people Social benefits outweighed the country’s huge economic loss, with the ‘railways’ needing further upgradation, expansion and public orientation Electric Telegraphs: served the purpose of maintaining law and order in remote parts. Postal Services: were useful but remained inadequate. Development of the Inland Trade and Sea Lanes: Mixed reaction to the development of these as sometimes they proved uneconomical (Coast Canal on the Orissa coast) Types of Economic Systems: A Simplified Guide with a Focus on Indian Economy Central Questions in Economic Management: In managing an economy, three central questions arise: what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce. These questions guide decisions on what goods to make based on market demand, the choice of production techniques, and the distribution of goods based on income and resource availability Central Problems of an Economy Explaination What to Produce Relates to the selection of goods to be produced based on market analysis and consumer demand. How to Produce Relates to the selection of the technique of production, such as labor-intensive or capital-intensive methods. For Whom to Produce Relates to determining the part of society for whom goods are produced, considering income distribution and resource availability. Exploring Capitalist (Market) Economy: Insights and Its Relevance to Indian Economy Distribution of Goods in a Capitalist System: In a capitalist system, the products manufactured are divided among people not according to what people want but on the foundation of Purchasing Power – which is the ability to buy products and services. Which means an individual needs to have the money with him to buy the goods and services. Example: The affordable housing for the underprivileged is much required but will not include demand in the market because the needy do not have the buying power to back the demand. Therefore, the commodity will not be manufactured and provided as per market forces. FEATURES MERITS DEMERITS Freedom of Enterprise: E very individual is free to make his own economic choices Increase in production Leads to monopoly Right to Private Property: Every individual can acquire any amount of property Flexible system Inequalities Freedom of choice to the consumers Optimum use of resources Depression and unemployment Competition among producers and sellers Progress and prosperity Insufficient production More scope for innovation Quality products at low costs Class conflict Socialist Economic System: Government Control and Its Implications on Indian Economy Central Planning: In a socialist society, the government determines what products are to be manufactured in accordance with the requirements of society. Collective Decision-Making: It is believed that the government understands what is appropriate for the citizens of the country, therefore, the passions of individual buyers are not given much attention. Production and Disposal: The government concludes how products are to be created and how the product should be disposed of. Need-Based Distribution: In principle, sharing under socialism is assumed to be based on what an individual needs and not what they can buy. Absence of Private Ownership: A socialist system does not have a separate estate because everything is controlled by the government. FEATURES MERITS DEMERITS Increase government control and decrease private power Welfare state Non-cooperation between the two sectors Existence of economic planning Better allocation of the resources Inefficient Public sector Conducive policies by the government. for private sector Promotes the equitable distribution of wealth and social justice Economic fluctuation and Administered prices are not the most efficient Planned and definite economic role of govt. Ensures that all citizens have the means to achieve a minimum living standard Breeding ground for corruption, red-tapism, and favoritism. Consumers do not have absolute freedom of choice. It provides comprehensive social security to all its members Socialism does not promote hard work or any creativity in its citizens. Mixed Economy: The Blend of Socialism and Capitalism in Indian Economy Defining the Golden Blend: It is a golden combination of a command (Socialist) Indian economy and a market (Capitalist) economy. For this purpose, the mixed economic systems are also called dual economic systems . Challenges in Defining Mixed Economic Systems: However, there is no sincere method to determine a mixed system , sometimes the word represents a market system beneath the strict administrative control in certain sections of the Indian economy. Indian Economy: Objectives and Strategies in a Mixed Economic System FEATURES MERITS DEMERITS Combination of a command economy and a market Indian economy. Healthy competition in the market. The public sector gets maximum benefits whereas the private sector remains controlled. Coexistence of All Sectors: In a mixed economy all three sectors coexist in harmony Enjoys the advantages of central economic planning Inefficient Planning: large sectors of the Indian economy remain outside the control of the government. Social Welfare: aims to reduce the wealth gap in the country and fight the inequalities. Indian Economy freedom to ownership of property and choice of goods and services. Ineffectiveness of Sectors: private sector does not get full freedom, hence it becomes ineffective. This leads to ineffectiveness among the public sector. Indian Economy Planning: General guideline for economic growth and prosperity of the nation. Existence of price mechanism. So the allocation of resources is more scientific and beneficial to the Indian economy. Constant fear of nationalization of the private sector. Existence of Cooperative Sector Corruption and Black Marketing Economic Models Demystified: Capitalist, Socialist, and Mixed Approaches with a Focus on Indian Economy PARAMETER CAPITALIST SOCIALIST MIXED Ownership of Property Private public Both public and private Price Determination determined by the market forces of demand and supply determined by the central planning authority. determined by central planning authority and demand & supply. Motive of Production Profit motive Social welfare The profit motive in the private sector and welfare motive in the public sector Role of Government No role Complete role Full role in the public sector and limited role in the private sector Competition Exists No competition Exist only in the private sector Distribution of income Very Unequal Quite Equal Considerable inequalities exist. WHAT TYPE OF ECONOMY IS INDIA? India’s Mixed Economic Landscape: Indian Economy is a mixed economy. Nearly half of India’s working population is engaged in agriculture , the signature of an Indian economy. One-third of its workers are employed by the services industry , which contributes two-third of India’s output. Market-driven Productivity: The productivity of this segment is made possible by India’s shift towards a market Indian economy. Deregulation and Privatisation: Since the 1990s, India has deregulated several industries. It has privatized many state-owned enterprises, and opened doors to foreign direct investment. Adopting a Mixed Economy: Reasons and Implications for Indian Economy Landscape Balancing Public and Private Sectors: To maintain a healthy balance between the public and the private sector. This ensures cooperation and competition between them which is conducive to attain high growth targets. Efficient Resource Allocation: Through its pricing mechanisms as well as freedoms of production, consumption, occupation, and the presence of a profit motive, it ensures that there is an efficient allocation of resources in the Indian economy. Addressing Inequalities: By working towards minimizing the inequalities of income, wealth etc. Tackling Unemployment and Poverty: Eliminating unemployment and poverty . Maximizing Social Welfare: Mixed Indian economy maximizes social welfare. It has all the main features of a welfare state. Concept of ‘Plan’ in Indian Economy: A Closer Look at India’s Five-Year Plans The Role of Plans in Economic Management: A plan spells out how the resources of a nation should be put to use. It should have some general goals as well as specific objectives which are to be achieved within a specified period of time ; The Structure of Indian Planning: In India plans are of five years duration and are called five year plans ( we borrowed this from the former Soviet Union ). Setting Objectives: Our plan documents specify the objectives to be attained in the five years of a plan and what is to be achieved over a period of twenty years (called as perspective plan) In 1950, the Planning Commission was set up with the Prime Minister as its Chairperson and the era of five year plans had begun. Indian Economy: Exploring Types of Economic Planning in Simple Terms Directional Planning Directional type of planning followed by countries which believe in socialism . The targets of plans are pre-determined and executed with the help of the government in power. In Directional type of planning all things are under control of the state including, financial institutions, industrial sector, transport, infrastructure, etc. Planning by Inducement This planning is independent planning. In this type, the state regulates and controls the process of production, forming the enterprise and various patterns of consumption. The government formulates various monetary and fiscal policies to regulate the Indian economy effectively. Perspective Planning Perspective planning is long term planning for a time period of 20 to 25 years . It’s an outline of development to be undertaken over a longer period in a phased manner . They can further be divided into annual plans . These five-year plans generally maintain continuity . Indicative Planning Indicative planning is a comparatively flexible type (soft planning) of planning, as it is different from comprehensive or imperative planning. It works on decentralized principles in the completion of target plans. In this planning, the targets for the public sector are mandatory while for the private sector they are only indicative . It was initially used in countries like France and Japan . Imperative Planning In this, the government in power directs and controls all the Indian economy activities and resources in the Indian economy. All available resources are used with high efficiency to complete set targets of the plan. Since the government’s decision and policymaking is very rigid they are to be followed by the market players. Imperative planning is in use in Russia and China . Democratic Planning The basic ideology in democratic planning is to form the democratic form of government . Plans are prepared according to the requirements and needs of the people. The discussion with various parties involved in the economy is the main principle of democratic planning. Aim of democratic planning is eradicating inequalities of income and wealth. Fixed planning Plans are prepared for a fixed period of time . The objectives and targets of a fixed plan are to be achieved within the plan period. Physical targets and spending on these targets are often not changed except during an emergency. Fixed planning is used in India. Centralized Planning The centralized authority plans and formulates all planning activities in the country in centralized planning. This authority fixes targets for all industries and fixes priorities for all sectors . It takes all the investment decisions according to the goals and targets set in the plan. Decentralized Planning In decentralized planning, the plans are executed at the grass-roots level . In this, the plan is prepared by the central authority along with discussion with all the administrative units in the country, whether at the state or district level. Plans for industries are prepared with full discussion with all the major representative stakeholders in the industries. INDIAN ECONOMY – POST-INDEPENDENCE ERA (1950-1990) Planning in Indian Economy Pre-independence Planning Post-Independence Planning 1. PRE-INDEPENDENCE PLANNING IN INDIAN ECONOMY M. Visvesvaraya’s “Planned Indian Economy”: Visvesvaraya published his book “Planned Indian economy” in 1934. In this book, he presents a constructive draft of the development of India in 10 years . His core idea was to lay out a plan to shift labor from agriculture to industries and double national income in ten years. This was the first concrete scholarly work on planning. INC Sessions of 1931 and 1936: The Indian economy perspective of India’s freedom movement was formulated during the Karachi session of INC (1931), Faizpur session of INC (1936). National Planning Committee (1938): This was the first attempt to develop a national plan for India. This committee was set up by Congress president Subhash Chandra Bose and was chaired by Jawaharlal Nehru. However, the reports of the committee could not be prepared, and only for the first time in 1948–49 did some papers come out. Bombay Plan: In 1944, industrialists in Bombay, including Mr. JRD Tata, GD Birla, Purshottamdas Thakurdas, Lala Shriram, Kasturbhai Lalbhai, AD Shroff, Ardeshir Dalal, & John Mathai, worked together to prepare “A Brief Memorandum Outlining a Plan of Indian Economy Development for India,” which was popularly known as the Bombay Plan. This plan envisaged doubling the per capita income in 15 years and tripling the national income during this period. In August 1944 , the British Indian government set up a “Planning and Development Department” under the charge of Ardeshir Dalal . But this department was abolished in 1946. People’s Plan: The plan was based upon Marxist socialism and drafted by M. N. Roy . This plan was for a ten-year period and gave the greatest priority to agriculture . The nationalization of all agriculture and production was the main feature of this plan. Gandhian Plan (1944 ): Put forward by Sri Shriman Narayan in 1944 who was principal of Wardha Commercial College . It was a modest kind of plan. The plan emphasized economic decentralization with primacy for rural development by developing cottage industries . Sarvodaya Plan (1950 ): Plan was drafted by Jaiprakash Narayan inspired by Gandhian plan as well as Sarvodaya Idea of Vinoba Bhave . It emphasized small and cotton industries and agriculture as well. Plan also stressed upon land reforms and decentralized participatory planning . 2. POST-INDEPENDENCE Economic Programme Committee (EPC): formed by All India Congress Committee (AICC) with Nehru as its chairman . The aim of this committee was to make a plan which could balance private and public partnership and urban and rural economies . The EPC recommended in 1948 to form a permanent Planning Commission in India. Establishment of the Planning Commission (1950): In March 1950 in pursuance of declared objectives of the Government, the Planning Commission was set up by a Resolution , with Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Chairman of the Planning Commission. Mandate of the Planning Commission: The Planning Commission was charged with the responsibility of making assessment of all resources of the country, augmenting deficient resources, formulating plans for the most effective and balanced utilization of resources and determining priorities. Democratic Socialism: Nehru was greatly influenced by the achievements of Soviet Planning; The philosophy was to not only check the growth of monopolistic tendencies of the private sector but also provide freedom to the private sector to play for the main objective of social gain rather than Indian economy gain. Indian Economy: Unpacking the Objectives of Five-Year Plans GROWTH Definition: Growth refers to an increase in the country’s capacity to produce the output of goods and services within the country. Growth Measure: Good indicator of Indian economic growth is the steady increase in the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – the market value of all the goods and services produced in the country during a year. Sectoral Composition of India’s GDP: The GDP of a country is derived from the different sectors (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary) of the Indian economy. The contribution made by each of these sectors makes up the structural composition of the Indian economy . Modernisation Definition: Steps taken by a factory to increase output by using a new type of machine and technology is called modernization. Social Evolution: Modernisation also leads to changes in social outlook such as the recognition that women should have the same rights as men. Self Reliance Promoting Economic Growth and Modernization: A nation can promote Indian economy growth and modernisation by using its own resources or by using resources imported from other nations. Emphasis on Self-Reliance in Planning: The first seven five year plans gave importance to self-reliance which means avoiding imports of those goods which could be produced in India itself, in order to reduce our dependence on foreign countries, especially for food. Safeguarding Sovereignty: There was a fear that dependence on imported food supplies, foreign technology and foreign capital may make India’s sovereignty vulnerable to foreign interference in our policies. Contemporary Call for Self-Reliance: Recently, PM stressed for a self-reliant India (Atma Nirbhar Bharat) in the backdrop of the Covid-19 outbreak. Equity Ensuring Prosperity Reaches All: To ensure that the benefits of Indian economy prosperity reach the poor sections as well instead of being enjoyed only by the rich. Reducing Wealth Inequality: Every Indian should be able to meet his or her basic needs such as food, a decent house, education, and health care; and reducing inequality in the distribution of wealth. OBJECTIVES OF PLANNING: Insights into Indian Economic Development Indian Economy, Social Planning, and the Establishment of a Welfare State Pattern. Sustainable Indian economic growth. Poverty alleviation Employment generation and self-employment Focus on Agriculture Sector: Modernizing the traditional Indian economy was set as a foremost objective of planning especially the agriculture sector Alignment with Constitutional Aspirations: According to place and weightage to all the aspirations of the Preamble , the Fundamental Duties , the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of the State Policy – adequate means of livelihood, opportunities for employment and a socio-economic order based on justice and equality. Promotion of Self-Reliance: Self-reliance, an effort to strike against a subordinate position in the world economy. Ensuring economic equality Financial Resources for Indian Economy Development Central Budget and State Budgets: revenue and capital receipt side Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) Domestic Private Sector Gross Budgetary Support: This is an amount from the central budget which goes to fund the planned investment during the plan period. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India Prime Moving Force – Agriculture VS. INDUSTRY Infrastructure Deficiency: The government of the time opted for industry to be India’s prime moving force of the Indian economy. Shortage of Basic Industries: Given the available resource base it seems an illogical decision as India lacked all those prerequisites which could suggest the declaration of industry as its prime mover – Almost no presence in the infrastructure sector. Lack of robust infrastructure industries, i.e., iron and steel, cement, coal, crude oil, oil refining and electricity. Capital Constraints: Lack of availability of investible capital – either by the government or the private sector. Absence of required technology to support the process of industrialisation and lack of research and development. Lack of skilled and semi-skilled manpower. Lack of entrepreneurship spirit among the people. Lack of a market for industrial goods. Many other socio-psychological factors that acted as negative forces for the proper industrialisation of the Indian economy. The obvious choice for India would have been the agriculture sector as the prime moving force of the Indian economy because: Abundance of Fertile Land: The country was having the natural resource of fertile land which was fit for cultivation. Human capital did not require any kind of higher training. Higher population in rural areas with involvement in agriculture Just by organizing our land ownership, irrigation and other inputs to agriculture, India could have gone for better prospects of development. Once the masses were able to achieve a level of purchasing capacity through remunerative income from agriculture, India could have gone for the expansion of industries. Following developments were in favor of industrialisation – Positive Shifts in the Indian Economy By choosing industry as the prime moving force, India opted to industrialise the Indian economy as well as modernise the traditional mode of farming. The dominant ideology around the world as well as in the WB (World Bank) and the IMF (International Monetary Fund) was in favour of industrialisation as a means to faster growth and development. The Second World War had proved the supremacy of defence power, which needs support not just of science and technology, but also of a robust industrial base. India also required a powerful defence base for herself as a deterrent force. By the time of independence the might of industrialisation was already proven, and there were no doubts regarding its efficacy. A major shift took place in the Indian economic landscape, when the government announced in 2002 that, from now on, agriculture will be the prime moving force of the Indian economy. According to the Planning Commission such a policy shift will solve the following major challenges faced by the Indian economy: The Indian economy will be able to achieve food security with the increase in agricultural production. The agricultural surplus will generate exports in the globalizing world economy, benefiting out of the WTO (World Trade Organisation) regime. The challenge of poverty alleviation will be solved to a great extent as the emphasis will make agriculture a remunerative occupation and induce growth in the rural economy by generating more gainful employment. The situation of India as an example of ‘market failure’ will cease. Indian Economy : A Close Look at Planned and Mixed Economy Models Post-independence, India was declared to be a planned and a mixed Indian economy. India was not only facing regional disparities at the level of resources, but inter-regional disparities were also prevalent, for centuries. Deeply entrenched mass poverty could only be remedied once the government started the process of Indian economy planning. The abject poverty of the masses made the government go for planning so that it could play an active role in the allocation of resources and mobilise them for equitable growth and development. Although, constitutionally India was declared a federation of states, in the process of planning, the authority of regulation, directing and undertaking Indian economy activities got more and more centralised in the Union government. Following factors made pressing points to opt for planned and mixed Indian economy – Great Depression (1929) and the reconstruction challenges after the second world War favoured a state intervention in the Indian economy In the 1950s and 1960s , the dominant view among policymakers around the world was in favour of an active role of the state in the Indian economy – Soviet Union and the East European countries were notable examples . A dominant role of the State in the Indian economy to neutralise market failure situations The dominant force behind planning in India was Nehru himself who had strong socialist leanings . WHY EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC SECTOR : Rationale and Impact on Indian Economy The state was to be given an active and dominant role in the Indian economy, it was very much decided by the time India became independent. Naturally, there was going to be a giant structure of the government-controlled enterprises to be known as the PSUs. The reason behind the ambitious expansion of the PSUs was in the face of the following major requirements: Infrastructural Needs Industrial Needs Employment Generation Development of the Social Sector Emergence of the Private Sector Building the Indian Economy: The Simplified Nehru-Mahalanobis Model The turning point in India’s planning strategy came with the second five-year (1956- 61) plan. The model adopted for the plan is known as the Nehru-Mahalanobis strategy of development as it was articulated by Jawahar Lal Nehru’s vision and P.C. Mahalnobis was its chief architect. The Mahalanobis model of growth was based on the predominance of the basic goods (Capital goods or investment goods that are used to make further goods). It was based on the premise that it would attract all round investment and result in a higher rate of growth of output in the Indian Economy . That will develop a small scale and ancillary industry to boost employment generation, poverty alleviation, exports, etc. Other elements of the model were – Import Substitution: Protective barriers against foreign competition to enable Indian companies to develop domestically produced alternatives for imported goods. A sizable public sector is active in vital areas of the Indian economy, including atomic energy and rail transport. A vibrant small-scale sector driving consumer goods production for dispersed and equitable growth and producing entrepreneurs. Model Effects: Impacts on the Indian Economy In terms of the core objective of raising the rate of growth of industrial production, the strategy was successful. Rate of growth of overall industrial production picked up. The strategy laid the foundation for a well-diversified industrial structure within a reasonably short period and this was a major achievement in the Indian Economy . It gave the basis for self-reliance . Criticism – There are visible imbalances between the growth of the heavy industry sector and other spheres like agriculture and consumer goods etc. It heavily relied on trickle-down effects. The benefits of growth will flow to all sections in course of time in the Indian Economy . Eradication of poverty is slow and incremental. Strategy for Indian Economy – RAO-MANMOHAN SINGH MODEL OF GROWTH Indian Economy reforms since 1991 are based on Rao-Manmohan model (Narsimha Rao, PM and Manmohan Singh, Finance minister) Features of model Selectively dismantle controls and permits in order to permit the private sector to invest liberally. Reorient the role of the state in Indian economy management. State should refocus on social and infrastructural development. External sector liberalization in order to integrate the Indian economy with the global economy and benefit from the resource flow and competition. Open up the Indian economy and create competition for PSEs – for better profitability, productivity and efficiency. Forex reserves accumulation thus alleviating the BoP pressures and the foreign flows – FDI and FII increased. Indian economy became competitive. Its success is seen in the more than 6.5% average annual rate of growth of the Indian economy during the 8th Plan (1992-1997). Forex reserves accumulated leaving the BOP crisis in history; taming of inflation; and the foreign flows- FDI and FII increased. Five-Year Plans: Duration and Performance Analysis in Indian Economy PLANS DESCRIPTION First Five Year Plan Duration: from 1951 to 1956 . Focus: Agriculture sector including irrigation and power projects. Targeted growth rate: 2.1 percent Achieved growth rate of 3.6% (more than its target) It was based on the Harrod-Domar model. About 44.6 percent of the plan outlay went in favor of public sector undertakings (PSUs). Launching of Community Development Programme (2 oct 1952) Imperial Bank of India transformed into State Bank Of India (Gorwala Committee recommendations) At the end of this plan, five IITs were set up in the country. Second Five Year Plan Duration: from 1956 to 1961 Focus: rapid industrialisation with a focus on heavy industries and capital goods India only achieved 4.27% income growth, falling short of the targeted 4.5%. It was based on the P.C. Mahalanobis Model . Second Industrial Policy, 1955 – divided industries into three schedules. Target of achieving “Socialistic pattern of society” in economic policies – failed to achieve Collaboration with countries like the USSR, UK, and West Germany helped establish hydroelectric power projects, steel plants, and railway lines in Northeast India. India faced an external payment crisis in 1957. Third Five Year Plan Duration: from 1961 to 1966 . This plan is called ‘Gadgil Yojana’ . Target Growth: 5.6% Actual Growth: 2.8% Its aim was to make India a ‘self-reliant’ and ‘self-generating’ economy. Based on the experience of first two plans (agricultural production was seen as limiting factor in India’s economic development) , agriculture was given top priority to support exports and industry. The Plan was thorough failure to reach the targets due to unforeseen events: Chinese aggression (1962), Indo-Pak war (1965), severe drought 1965-66. Due to conflicts the approach during the later phase was shifted from development to defence & development. Severe Famine: – 1965 -1966 The main target of this plan was to make the Indian economy independent and to reach the self-active position of take-off. For the first time, it was considered the aim of balanced, regional development. Established Food Corporation Of India (FCI) in 1965 Three annual plans (plan holiday) (1966-1969) Duration: from 1966 to 1969. Reason: Failure of Third Plan that of the devaluation of rupee( to boost exports) along with inflationary recession led to postponement of Fourth FYP. Three Annual Plans were introduced instead. Focus: Self reliance During this plan, annual plans were made and equal priority was given to agriculture & its allied sectors and the industry sector . Prevailing crisis in agriculture and serious food shortage necessitated the emphasis on agriculture during the Annual Plans. The Green revolution ushered in this period. (1966-67) It involving wide-spread distribution of high-yielding varieties of seeds, extensive use of fertilizers, exploitation of irrigation potential and soil conservation During the Annual Plans, the economy absorbed the shocks generated during the Third Plan It paved the path for the planned growth ahead. Fourth Five Year Plan Duration: from 1969 to 1974 . Objectives: Refusal of supply of essential equipments and raw materials from the allies during Indo Pak war resulted in twin objectives of “ growth with stability “ and “progressive achievement of self reliance “ for the Fourth Plan. Targeted growth rate: 5.7 percent Achieved growth rate of 3.3% ( plan failed to achieve targeted growth rate ) During this plan, the slogan of “ Garibi Hatao” was given during the 1971 elections by Indira Gandhi. Enactment of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act ( FERA 1973 ), Monopolistic & Restrictive Trade Practices Act ( MRTP 1969 ) Main emphasis was on growth rate of agriculture to enable other sectors to move forward . First two years of the plan saw record production. Implementation of Family Planning programs were amongst major targets of the Plan. Influx of Bangladeshi refugees before and after 1971 Indo-Pak war was an important issue along with price situation deteriorating to crisis proportions and the plan is considered as big failure. Nationalization of 14 banks in 1969 Fifth Five Year Plan Duration: From 1974 to 1979. Prepared and launched by D.P. Dhar in the backdrop of economic crisis arising out of run-away inflation fuelled by hike in oil prices and failure of the Govt. takeover of the wholesale trade in wheat. Objectives: It proposed to achieve two main objectives: ‘ removal of poverty ‘ (Garibi Hatao) and ‘ attainment of self reliance ‘, Promotion of high rate of growth, better distribution of income and significant growth in the domestic rate of savings were seen as key instruments Due to high inflation, cost calculations for the Plan proved to be completely wrong and the original public sector outlay had to be revised upwards. After promulgation of emergency in 1975 , the emphasis shifted to the implementation of Prime Ministers 20 Point Programme(1975) Targeted growth rate: 4.4 percent Achieved growth rate of 4.8% (plan was successful ) First population policy of India was declared in 1976. Integrated Child Development Scheme ( ICDS ) launched in 1975-76 The Plan was terminated, when Janta Party came to power in 1978 Rolling Plan Duration – From 1978 to 1980. “Rolling Plan” concept was envisaged and coined by Prof. Gunnar Myrdal in “India’s Economic Planning in its Broader Setting” The Food for Work programme was launched. Antyodaya scheme New lease of life to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) (i.e., the 2nd Phase of the revival of the PRIs); Rolling Plan Duration: 1978-1980 There were two Sixth Plans in India. The Janata Government made a plan for 1978-1983, focusing on creating jobs . They criticized the previous Nehru Model for concentrating power, making inequality worse, and increasing poverty. But the Janata Government only lasted for two years. The Congress Government came back to power in 1980 and introduced a new plan . Their plan aimed to fight poverty directly by making the economy grow. Sixth Five Year Plan Duration – from 1980 to 1985 . Targeted growth rate – 5.2 percent Achieved growth rate of 5.7% (plan was successful) Objective – poverty eradication and Employment generation. The Plan focussed on Increase in national income, modernization of technology, ensuring continuous decrease in poverty and unemployment through schemes TRYSEM and IRDP and providing slack season employment NREP, controlling population explosion etc. It was based on investment Yojana, infrastructural changing and trend in the growth model. Launched – National Rural Employment Programme ( NREP ) on 2 Oct 1980 Integrated Rural Development Programme ( IRDP ) Nationalization of six banks in 1980 (Second round of nationalization) Establishment of NABARD in 1982 on recommendations of Sivaraman Committee. The Sixth Plan was mostly successful because it achieved its goals. But in the last year (1984-85), many places in the country suffered from severe famine, and the amount of food grown was less than the year before. Seventh Five Year Plan Duration – from 1985 to 1990. Objectives – emphasized on rapid food grain production, increased employment creation and raising productivity with focus on ‘food, work & productivity’. Targeted growth rate – 5 percent Achieved growth rate of 6% (plan was successful) Indicative planning started for Sci & Tech. Launched Jawahar Rojgar Yojana (JRY) in 1989 – first decentralized scheme For the first time, the private sector gets priority over the public sector. The Plan was not laid with a strong financial strategy, which put the economy into a crisis of unsustainable balance of payments and fiscal deficits The plan was very successful as the economy grew by 6%, beating the goal of 5%. It helped the economy move away from the slow growth of the 1980s known as the ‘Hindu Rate of Growth’. Two Annual Plans 1990-91 & 1991-92. The Eighth Plan (1990–95) could not take off due to the ‘fast- changing political situation at the Centre Fiscal imbalances of the late 1980s were the other important reasons for the delay in the launch of the Eighth Plan. BoP(Balance of Payment) crisis and shortage of FOREX Uncontrollable fiscal deficit Eighth Five Year Plan Duration: from 1992 to 1997 . Targeted growth rate: 5.6 percent Achieved growth rate of 6.8% (plan was successful) Objective: Development of human resources i.e. employment, education, and public health. Adoption of Indicative planning in totality Narasimha Rao Govt. launched the New Economic Policies of India Rao-Manmohan Model: LPG (Liberalization, Privatisation, Globalization) Constitution of Disinvestment Commission in 1996 Launching of – Mid Day Meal Scheme, MPLADS, National Social Asst. Programme Constitutional status to Panchayat Raj Institution in 1992 by 73 rd and 74 th Amendment acts. Statutory Status to SEBI (Securities & Exchange Board of India) in 1992 Ninth Five Year Plan Duration: from 1997 to 2002. Targeted growth rate: 6.5 percent Achieved growth rate of 5.4% Objective: “Growth With Social Justice & Equality”. It was launched in the 50th year of independence of India. Ninth Plan aimed to depend predominantly on the private sector – Indian as well as foreign (FDI) State was envisaged to increasingly play the role of facilitator & increasingly involve itself with social sector. viz education , health etc and infrastructure where private sector participation was likely to be limited. It assigned priority to agriculture & rural development with a view to generate adequate productive employment and eradicate poverty . Plan was launched when there was an all-round ‘slowdown’ in the economy led by the South East Asian Financial Crisis (1996–97). Launched National Population Policy, National Population fund and Population Stabilization Fund in 2000. Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rojgaar Yojana (SJSRY) and Swarna Jayanti Gram Swarojgaar Yojana (SGSY) were launched. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan launched in 2001. Tenth Five Year Plan Duration: from 2002 to 2007 . Objective: aims to double the Per Capita Income of India in the next 10 years. Targeted Growth Rate: 8 percent Achieved growth rate of 7.6 % To achieve an over all growth rate of 7 percent per annum . Plan aims to reduce the poverty ratio by 15% by 2012. To reduce poverty through income- and employment generating programmes. For the first time the Plan went to set the ‘monitorable targets’ for eleven select indicators of development for the Centre as well as for the states ‘Governance’ was considered a factor of development States’ role in planning to be increased with the greater involvement of the PRIs Policy and institutional reforms in each sector—reforms in the PSUs, legal reforms, administrative reforms, labor reforms, etc Agriculture sector was declared as the prime moving force (PMF) of the economy in 2002. Increased emphasis on the social sector – About 27% of total outlay. To improve the health parameters by reducing the birth rate, death rate, and infant mortality rate, to reduce the gap between the state and national average. To provide potable drinking water to all the villages in the state. To ensure social, economic and political empowerment of the weaker sections of the society. To increase the literacy rate to 75 percent within the plan period. To bring down the population growth rate to 1.62 percent by 2011. Eleventh Five Year Plan Duration – from 2007 to 2012 . Targeted growth rate – 9 percent Achieved growth rate of 8 % Objective – “ Towards Faster & More Inclusive Growth”” Plan target of 9-10 per cent GDP growth. It was prepared by C. Rangarajan India became one of the fastest-growing economies by the end of the Tenth Plan. Savings and investment rates went up, and the industrial sector did well in global competition. Foreign investors were interested in investing in India. However, the growth didn’t include everyone equally, especially marginalized groups like SCs, STs, and minorities. Data showed problems like poverty, malnutrition, high mortality rates, and limited employment opportunities for many. The Eleventh Plan aimed at rapid growth, poverty reduction, employment creation, and improving access to health and education. Specific targets included reducing unemployment among educated youth, decreasing poverty headcount ratio, improving literacy and gender equality, and enhancing healthcare. It began well with 9.3% growth in the first year but slowed to 6.7% in 2008-09 due to the global financial crisis. Recovery followed with growth rates of 8.6% and 9.3% in 2009-10 and 2010-11. Growth decelerated again to 6.2% in 2011-12 due to global and domestic factors. The average annual GDP growth during the plan was 8%, lower than the target but better than the Tenth Plan. Agriculture, industry, and services sectors achieved growth rates close to their targets. Domestic savings and investment fell slightly below the plan’s targets. Poverty declined by 1.5 percentage points annually between 2004-05 and 2009-10, faster than the previous period. Government’s expansionary measures initially increased key indicators, but there was moderation later. Price stability was a challenge throughout the plan, partly due to the inability to pass on higher oil prices, impacting investible funds. Twelfth Five Year Plan Duration – from 2012 to 2017 . Objective – “Faster, More Inclusive and sustainable growth” Growth rate target is 9%. Broad Objectives of 12th Five Year Plan To reduce poverty To improve regional equality across states and within states To improve living conditions for SCs, STs, OBCs, Minorities To generate attractive employment opportunities for Indian youth. To eliminate gender gaps. Economic Growth Real GDP Growth Rate of 8.0 per cent. Agriculture Growth Rate of 4.0 per cent. Manufacturing Growth Rate of 10 per cent. Every State must have an average growth rate in the Twelfth Plan preferably higher than that achieved in the Eleventh Plan. Head-count ratio of consumption poverty to be reduced by 10 percentage points over the preceding estimates by the end of Twelfth FYP. Mean Years of Schooling to increase to seven years by the end of Twelfth FYP. Reduce IMR to 25 and MMR to 1 per 1,000 live births , and improve Child Sex Ratio (0–6 years) to 950 by the end of the Twelfth FYP. Reduce Total Fertility Rate to 2.1 by the end of Twelfth FYP. Increase green cover (as measured by satellite imagery) by 1 million hectare every year during the Twelfth FYP. Increase investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP to 9 per cent by the end of Twelfth FYP Provide access to banking services to 90 per cent Indian households by the end of Twelfth FYP. CONCLUSION To conclude, India’s five year plans did not achieve much in terms of what they set out to do. The Indian economic progress that we have witnessed so far is, by and large, a result of the opening up of India’s economy post 1991 BoP crisis . Today the private sector has overtaken the public sector and taken the lead across various sectors of the Indian economy. There are both positive and negative aspects to this. Indian Economy: Multi-Level Planning: An Examination in the Indian Context By the mid-1960s , the states were given the power to plan, by the Centre, advising them that they should promote planning at the lower levels of the administrative strata. By the early 1980s , India was a country of multi-level planning (MLP) with the structure and strata of planning as follows: Centre-Level Planning: The Multi-Level Planning in Indian Economy At center-level planning, three types of Central Plans had evolved over the years – Five Year Plans , Twenty-Point Programme and MPLADS (Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme) State-Level Planning: The Second Strata in Multi-Level Planning for Indian Economy By the 1960s, the states were planning at the state level with their respective planning bodies , (State Planning Boards), with the respective CMs being their Chairman. The plans of the states were for a term of five years, parallel to the concerned Five Year Plans of the Centre. District-Level Planning: Third Strata in Multi-Level Planning for Indian Economy By the late 1960s, all the districts of the states had their own plans with their respective District Planning boards, with the respective District Magistrate as chairman. District-level plans are currently executed through municipalities in urban areas and via blocks in rural areas by the panchayats. Indian Economy: Block-Level Planning as the Fourth Strata in Multi-Level Economic Strategy As a part of the district-level planning the block level planning came up which had the District Planning Boards as their nodal body. Because of socioeconomic differences among the population, local-level planning in India evolved with three variations, namely: i. Village-Level Planning ii. Hill Area Planning iii. Tribal Area Planning ACHIEVEMENTS OF PLANNING: Notable Achievements in Shaping the Indian Economy National income increased manifold in Indian Economy India became one of the largest and emerging economies in Asia, with a GDP of about 2.7 trillion USD. India has become the fifth-largest economy in 2019, overtaking the United Kingdom and France. India ranks third when GDP is compared in terms of purchasing power parity at $11.33 trillion. Improvement in social indicators (IMR, MMR, Literacy among others). Robust Industrial Sector: cement, fertilizers, steel, pharma, etc. Agriculture growth is also gaining momentum with record-breaking food grains productions. whopping rise in FOREX reserves—about 480 bn USD (June 2020) India holds a prominent position globally in the service sector, contributing significantly to the economy. Considerable expansion of the higher and vocational education sector—health universities, engineering institutions, etc. Poverty dropped to about 20% of the population Indian Economy: Understanding The Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) The MPLAD Scheme is a Central Sector Scheme, fully funded by the Government of India and was announced on December 23, 1993, by the Prime Minister of India in Parliament Initially the administration of MPLADS was with the Ministry of Rural Development. However, since October 1994, the administration of the Scheme has been vested with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The scheme was launched in 1993 with Rs. 2 crore given to each MP. In April 2011 the corpus was enhanced to Rs. 5 crore while announcing the new guidelines for the scheme. Under this scheme, the Members of Parliament recommend some works (i.e. creation of fixed community assets, based on locally felt developmental needs) to the concerned District Magistrate . Indian Economy: Analyzing the Failures of Planning Strategies High rate of unemployment Quality of outcome from education is dismal Rampant poverty. Gender parity is still steep and widespread R&D is not globally competitive along with poor spending (about 0.6% of GDP) Export growth is not much high. Regional imbalances are clearly visible Low productivity of agriculture sector Half of the children suffer from malnutrition. Pre-Reform Era (Pre-1990s): Shaping the Landscape of Indian Economy Achievements Acceleration of the Growth Rate: during the first three decades of planning, the growth rate averaged around 3.5 to 4 percent (known as Hindu growth rate , coined by Raj Krishna ) Growth of the Agriculture S ector: average spending on agriculture and allied sector was around 23–25 percent of the plan outlay in each FYP. Multipurpose projects such as the Damodar Valley and Bhakra Nangal brought prospects for agriculture, paving the way for initiatives like the Green Revolution . Development of Economic Infrastructure: development of irrigation projects, hydro electric projects, thermal power projects and expansion of network of surface transports. Development of heavy capital goods industry base. Failures Failure to create employment opportunities – India is facing a problem of underemployment and disguised unemployment. Failure to eradicate poverty – more than quarter of the population in India was living below poverty line even after four decades of planning, this speaks about the failure of planning in creating ‘growth for all’. Failure in undertaking land reforms and other institutional reforms in agriculture – productivity of agriculture is dismal. Non remunerative nature of agriculture. Failure in setting up a strong, competitive, diversified industrial base – promotion of capital goods industries by the state led to concentration and inefficiency. INDIAN ECONOMY REFORMS SINCE 1991 The origin of the financial crisis can be traced from the inefficient management of the Indian economy in the 1980s. Government’s expenditure was more than its income. UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 1980s: A Chapter In Indian Economy Government expenditure began to exceed its revenue by such large margins that meeting the expenditure through borrowings became unsustainable. There was a sharp rise in the prices of many essential goods. Imports grew at a very high rate without matching growth of exports. Foreign exchange reserves declined to a level that was not adequate to finance imports for more than two weeks. No sufficient foreign exchange to pay the interest to international lenders. To avert and mitigate the crisis, India approached the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and received $7 billion as loan to manage the crisis in Indian Economy. Indian Economy: How India Seeks Loans from IMF and World Bank 1. Liberalisation: Removing restrictions on the private sector 2. Privatisation: Reducing the role of the government in many areas 3. Globalisation: Removing trade restrictions IMF Support for Indian Economy: Conditions and Considerations Devaluation of the rupee by 22 percent. Drastic reduction in the peak import tariff from the prevailing level of 130 per cent to 30 per cent. Excise duties to be hiked by 20 percent to neutralize the revenue shortfalls due to the custom cut. All government expenditure to be cut down by 10 per cent, annually. India agreed to the conditionalities of World Bank and IMF and announced the New Economic Policy (NEP), which consisted of the following economic reforms: Creating a more competitive environment in the Indian economy by removing the barriers to entry and growth of firms; Introduced liberalization with a view to integrating the Indian economy with the world economy; To remove restrictions on FDI as well as to free the domestic entrepreneur from the restrictions of Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act; To unleash the Indian industrial economy from the web of unnecessary bureaucratic controls; To reduce the load of public sector enterprises which have shown a very low rate of return or have were incurring losses over the years. Why Economic Reforms? Understanding the Reasons Shaping Indian Economy Rise in Prices: Inflation surged from 7% to 16.7% . attributed to rapid increase in money supply. Rise in Fiscal Deficit: Due to an increase in non-development expenditure, the fiscal deficit of the government has been increasing. This was accompanied by a rise in public debt and resultant interest . Adverse Balance of Payments : When foreign exchange falls short for payment or total imports exceeds total exports, problems of adverse balance of payments arise. Iraq-Kuwait War 1990-91: This led to rise in petrol prices . The flow of remittances from Gulf countries stopped . Dismal Performance of the PSUs: These were not performing well due to political interference and became a big liability for the Government. Fall in Foreign Exchange Reserves – Indians foreign exchange reserve fell to lowest in 1990-91 and it was insufficient to pay for an import bill for 2 weeks (In 1989-90, it declined to Rs. 6252 crores) Balance of Payments of a country is the record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and the rest of the world in a particular period. Import cover measures the number of months of imports that can be covered with foreign exchange reserves (FOREX) available with the central bank of the country. Indian Economy: Charting the Course of Economic Reforms for Prosperity Indian Economy reforms is the process in which a government prescribes a declining role for the state and an expanding role for the private sector in the Indian economy. Indian Economy reforms started in India in 1991 have been widely termed by experts as gradualist or incremental in nature, with characteristic of occasional reversals . Process of economic reforms started in India with the motto and slogan of ‘reforms with human face’ . However, it has utterly failed to garner the empathy of the masses. Reforms are to benefit all. Countries such as Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, etc. also went for the stop-and-go approach of reforms, unlike India. In these reforms, the governments first decide the sector where reform is needed, then they pin-point the prerequisites , and finally both sets of reforms are activated simultaneously . Indian Economy: Important Reform Measures and Their Impact 1. Macroeconomic Stabilization Measures These include all those Indian economy policies which intend to boost the aggregate demand in the Indian economy, be it domestic or external. For enhancing domestic demand, increasing the purchasing power of the masses is essential, which connotes an emphasis on the creation of gainful and quality employment 2. Structural Reform Measures Measures that include all the policy reforms which have been initiated by the government to boost the aggregate supply of goods and services in the Indian economy. It naturally entails unshackling the economy so that it may search for its own potential of enhanced productivity. For the purchasing capacity of the people to be increased, the Indian economy needs increased income , which comes from increased levels of activities. Income so increased is later distributed among the people whose purchasing power has to be increased. This will take place by properly initiating a suitable set of macroeconomic policies. Indian Economy: The LPG Framework – Initiating Reforms The process of reforming the Indian Economy had to be completed via a roadmap of three processes: liberalisation , privatisation and globalisation (LPG). These three processes specify the characteristics and extent of the reform process India initiated. Liberalisation: the direction of reform Privatisation: the path of reform Globalisation: shows the ultimate goal of the reform. Opening Up: How Liberalization Changed in Indian Economy The term “liberalization” in this context implies liberalization of the Indian economy . This policy connotes that greater freedom is to be given to the entrepreneur of any industry , trade or business and that governmental control on the same be reduced to the minimum . Liberalization was introduced to put an end to regulations and restrictions and open up various sectors of the Indian economy. Only key issues of welfare and other regulatory mechanisms are left with the state. Understanding Indian Economy in Context of Liberalization Exploring Indian Economy Changes : Removal of Industrial Licensing and Registration Reducing the quantitative restrictions on imports also reduces import duties. Reduced control on FOREX management, both in current and capital accounts. Financial systems reforms Reduction in the level of both personal and corporate taxation. Liberalized rules for FDI and foreign portfolio investment (FPI). Opening of public-sector domains like power, transport, banking, etc to private players. Partial privatization of public sector units. Change in approach towards industrial sickness Key Steps in Liberalization: Exploring Important Measures for Indian Economy 1. Removal of Industrial Licensing: All industrial licensing was abolished except a shortlist of 18 industries related to security and strategic concerns, social reasons, hazardous chemicals and overriding environmental reasons. Subsequently, all industries except for a small group of five (alcohol, cigarettes, hazardous chemicals industrial explosives, electronics, aerospace and drugs and pharmaceuticals), industrial licensing requirements have been done away with. Reservations for the Public sector for defense equipment, atomic energy generation and railway transport. Market mechanism to determine the prices. 2. Financial Sector Reforms: The major aim of financial sector reforms is to reduce the role of the RBI from regulator to facilitator of the financial sector. The RBI regulates financial institutions such as commercial banks, investment banks, stock exchange operations, and foreign exchange markets. All the banks and other financial institutions in India are regulated through the various norms and regulations of the RBI. Financial sector reforms led to the establishment of private sector banks, both Indian and foreign. 3. Liberalization of Foreign Investment: Earlier, prior approval was required by foreign companies, now, automatic approvals are given for FDI to flow into the country. High-priority and investment-intensive industries were de-licensed and could now invite up to 100% FDI, including sectors such as hotel and tourism, infrastructure, software development,etc. Use of foreign brand name or trademark was permitted for sale of goods. 4. Public Sector Reforms: Greater autonomy was accorded to the PSUs in-order to restrict interference by government officials and allow their management greater freedom in decision-making. 5. MRTP Act : The Industrial Policy 1991 restructured the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act. Regulations relating to concentration of Indian economy power, pre-entry restrictions for setting up new enterprises, expansion of existing businesses, mergers and acquisitions etc. have been abolished . Effects of liberalization on Indian Economy India’s annual average growth rate ( GDP ) from 1990 – 2018 has been 7 % which is almost double than the pre-reforms era. Industrial Growth Rate: The performance of the industrial sector is dismal, barring a few exceptional years. Its share in GDP is still at 29% (2017–18). Foreign companies got free access to Indian markets and made domestic products uncompetitive. Indian Economy: Reasons for the Poor Industrial Growth Rate Lower productivity in industry than in services within India, predominance of the ‘unorganized’ sector ( accounts for almost two-thirds of industrial employment in India) Wages in India are low . However, manufacturing in India is more capital-intensive than in comparable countries. One cause of low productivity is poor infrastructural facilities. Transmission and distribution losses in the power sector in India are more than 20 per cent – higher than in any comparable country. State-owned power companies are inefficient and cannot supply electricity round the clock. World Bank studies have repeatedly found India to be low in ease of doing business as compared to its counterparts, such as China. Labour laws are more complicated and made by both the Centre and the states. India has invested too little in transport infrastructure , resulting in poor connectivity. The rise of twin balance sheet problems in India. Share of agriculture in the Indian economy has declined to about 17% (2017-18). However, people dependent upon agriculture are still around 47%. Indian Economy reform for agricultural development are critical for Raising living standards, Alleviating poverty, Assuring food security, Generating buoyant market for expansion of industry and services Making substantial contribution to the Indian economy growth PRIVATIZATION: Changing the Game in Indian Economy The policies through which the ‘roll back’ of the state was done included deregulation, privatization and introduction of market reforms in public services. Privatization at that time was used as a process under which state assets were transferred to the private sector. Another variant of privatization is disinvestment . Disinvestment is the de-nationalization of less than 100 percent of ownership transferred from the state to the private sector. If the sale of shares of the state-owned assets has been to the tune of 51 per cent , the ownership is really transferred to the private sector, even though it is termed privatization. In a general sense, all the policies of the Indian economy that directly or indirectly seem to promote the expansion of the private sector or the market ( Indian economy) have been termed the process of privatization. Globalization and Indian Economy: A Simplified Overview Globalization is defined as the increased integration of the Indian economy with nations worldwide. For the WTO , the official meaning of globalization is movement of the Indian economy around the world towards “unrestricted cross-border movements of goods and services, capital and the labor force”. Globalization is world economic integration through free movement across national borders of: Financial capital represented by investment in capital markets and money markets, Physical capital represented by plant and machinery Technology Aspects of Globalization: Understanding its Impact on Indian Economy To open the domestic markets for inflow of foreign goods, India reduced customs duties on imports to only 10% Import licensing has been almost abolished . Tariff barriers have also been significantly eliminated to encourage trade volume to rise, in keeping with the World trade Organization (WTO) Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) was liberalized in 1993 and the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999 was passed to enable foreign currency transactions. The FDI policy of the GoI encouraged the inflow of fresh foreign capital by allowing 100% foreign equity in certain projects under the automatic route. India signed many agreements with the WTO affirming its commitment to liberalize trade, such as TRIPs ( Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights), TRIMs ( Trade Related Investment Measures) and AOA (Agreement on Agriculture). EFFECT OF GLOBALIZATION ON INDIAN ECONOMY Positive Effects Increase in Foreign Trade: India’s share in world trade has gone up significantly post-globalization. Increase in Foreign Investment: The government started encouraging the entry of foreign investment, which resulted in an increase in FDI and FPI. Increase in Foreign Exchange Reserves: The foreign exchange reserves of India hovered around US$ 480 billion at the end March 2020. Increase in foreign collaborations and joint ventures, such as Dassault Aviation and Reliance Expansion of Market: Expanded size of market facilitated Indian business units to expand their business in the whole world—Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Tata Steel, etc. Technological Development: Technical collaboration of foreign companies enabled the inflow of modern advanced and superior foreign technology in India. Brand Development: Globalization has promoted the use of branded goods. Brand development has led to quality improvement. Development of Capital Market: helped in Indian capital market development. How many foreign investors invest in the Indian capital market? Increase in Employment: foreign companies are establishing their production and trading units in India. Reduction in brain Drain: many multinational corporations (MNCs) have set up their business units in India which provide attractive salary packages in India itself. Negative Effect Loss of Domestic Industries: Because of the better quality and low cost of foreign goods, foreign competition has increased in India. Problem of Unemployment: companies are using capital-intensive technology, so employment opportunities have reduced. Exploitation of Labour: exploitation of unskilled workers by giving lower wages, contractual long working hours, and worse working conditions. Increase in Inequalities: small and cottage industries are adversely hit by foreign industries. Bad Effect on Culture and Value System: The vulgar advertisements shown by some MNCs pollute the thinking of the young generation in India. Globalization: A Perspective on its Advocacy for Indian Economy Globalization promotes foreign direct investment, which in turn facilitates national development . Globalization helps developing countries make use of and adapt technologies developed by advanced countries without undertaking heavy expenditures in R&D. Globalization widens the access of developing countries to export their goods and services to developed countries. Globalization enables consumers in developing countries to acquire quality consumer goods , especially consumer durables, at relatively lower prices. Globalization facilitates faster diffusion of knowledge . It enables developing countries to attain international standards of production and productivity. By reducing tariffs and quantitative restrictions , globalization increases the share of foreign trade as a percentage of GDP. Conclusively , the proponents of globalization consider it as the engine of growth, technological advancement, raising levels of productivity, enlarging employment and bringing about poverty reduction with modernisation in the Indian Economy. Economic Reforms: Following the Generations Impacting Indian Economy During the launch of economic reforms in 1991, there were no such official announcements . In the coming times, many ‘generations’ of reforms were announced by the governments. A total of three generations of reforms have been announced till date, while experts have gone on to suggest the fourth generation as well. First Generation Economic Reforms (1991-2000): Transforming Indian Economy First Generation: Reforms from 1991 to 2000 were called by the government the reforms of the First Generation . It was in the year 2000–01 that the government, for the first time, announced the need for the Second Generation of Indian economy reforms, which was launched in the same year. The broad contours of the First Generation of reforms may be seen as follows: Promotion to Private Sector: Included various important and liberalizing policy decisions: de-reservation and de-licensing of industries, abolition of the MRTP limit, and simplifying environmental laws. Public Sector Reforms: The steps taken to make the PSUs profitable and efficient, including more autonomy in decision-making, disinvestment, corporatisation, etc. External Sector Reforms: Consisted of policies such as abolishing quantitative restrictions on import, switching to the floating exchange rate, full current account convertibility, reforms in the capital account, permission to foreign investment (direct and indirect), liberal Foreign Exchange Management Act, etc. Financial Sector Reforms: Initiatives were taken up in areas such as banking, capital market, insurance, mutual funds, etc. Tax Reforms: Consisted of all the policy initiatives directed towards simplifying, broadening, modernizing, checking evasion, DTAAs (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements), etc. Second Generation Reforms (2000-01 Onwards): The Evolution of Indian Economy The government launched the second generation of reforms in 2000–01 . The fact is, that the reforms India launched in the early 1990s were not taking place as intended and a need for another set of reforms was felt by the government. These reforms were not only deeper and more delicate , but they also required a higher level of political will power from the governments. The major components of the reform in Indian Economy are as follows: Factor Market Reforms: Considered as the ‘backbone’ for the success of the reform process in India, it consists of dismantling of the Administered Price Mechanism (APM). Now, only kerosene oil and LPG remain under the APM, while petrol, diesel (by March 2014) lubricants have been phased out. Opening the petroleum sector for private investment, cutting down the burden of levy on sugar, etc. Factor Market Reforms are still going on. Public Sector Reforms: especially emphasize areas like greater functional autonomy, freer leverage to the capital market, international tie-ups and greenfield ventures, disinvestment (strategic), etc. Reforms in Govt. and Public Institutions: Involves conversion of role of the government from the ‘controller’ to the ‘facilitator’ or the administrative reform. Legal Sector Reforms: Although started in the first generation, now it were to be deepened and newer areas were to be included, such as, abolishing outdated and contradictory laws , reforms in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), Labour Laws, Company Laws a nd enacting suitable legal provisions for new areas like Cyber Law , etc. Reforms in Critical Areas: reforms initiated in the infrastructure sector (power, roads, telecom, and energy sectors, among others), agriculture, agricultural extension, education, healthcare, etc. These areas have been called by the government as ‘ critical areas ’. Some other important areas were also emphasized: State’s Role in the Reform: All new steps of the reforms were now to be started by the state, with the center playing a supportive role. Fiscal Consolidation: The FRBM Act is passed by the Centre and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRAs) is followed by the states to ensure fiscal prudence. Greater Tax Devolution to the States: during the second generation of reforms, we see a visible change in the central policies favoring greater fiscal leverage for the states. Focusing on the Social Sector: especially healthcare and education , gets increased attention by the government with manifold increases in the budgetary outlay. Continued Evolution: Third Generation Reforms Building Indian Economy Announcement of the third generation of reforms were made on the launch of the Tenth Plan (2002–07): ‘inclusive growth and development’ This generation of reforms commits to the cause of a fully functional Panchayati Raj Institution (PRIs) so that the benefits of Indian economy reforms, in general, can trickle down to the grassroots . The constitutional arrangements for a decentralized developmental process was already affected by 73 rd and 74 th Amendments. It was agreed in the early 2000s that the government gets convinced of the need for ‘inclusive growth and development’ . Till then, the development process had lacked the ‘inclusion’ factor. FOURTH GENERATION REFORMS: The Path Forward for Indian Economy Fourth generation is not an official ‘generation’ of reform in India. In early 2002, some experts coined this generation of reforms, which entail a fully ‘information technology-enabled’ They hypothesized a ‘two-way’ connection between the Indian economy reforms and information technology (IT), with each one reinforcing the other. Indian Economy: Understanding the Concept of Disinvestment in Simple Terms Another variant of privatization is Disinvestment. Objectives of Disinvestment: The aim of disinvestment was to raise resources through the sale of PSUs to be directed towards social welfare expenditures, Raising the efficiency of PSUs through increased competition, Increasing consumer satisfaction with better-quality goods and services, Upgrading technology, Most importantly, removing political interference and increasing autonomy in decision-making in the Indian economy. After the Industrial Policy of 1956 , the socialization of the Indian economy was measured by the size of the public sector in the Indian economy. The greater the share of the public sector, the greater the degree of socialization of the Indian economy. Post-Indian economy reforms in 1991, the private sector is considered the engine of growth . The new environment assigned an increasing role for the private sector. Indian Economy: Exploring Reasons for PSU Disinvestment in India Indian PSUs had shown a very negative rate of return on capital employed. Inefficient PSUs had become and are continuing to be a drag on the government’s fiscal resources, turning out to be more liabilities to the government than assets. The national GDP and gross national savings were also getting adversely affected by low returns from PSUs. About 10 to 15 % of the total gross domestic savings were getting reduced on account of low savings from PSUs. Political interference in decision making Lack of standardization and competitiveness of the products Inefficiency and L ow Productivity: underutilization of resources in Indian Economy Advantages & Disadvantages: Understanding the Benefits of Disinvestment Proceeds in Indian Economy For financing and making up the increasing fiscal deficit . Resource Mobilization: the proceeds can be used to invest in other growth sectors, which can induce Indian economy activity and generate better returns for the government Financing large-scale infrastructure through disinvestment. Financing for social sectors (health, education, women and children) creates positive externality as it will facilitate more production and trade. Improve the overall efficiency of the PSUs; the inefficient PSUs will now be forced to make better achievable targets. THE RANGARAJAN COMMITTEE ON DISINVESTMENT 1993: Impact on Indian Economy The Rangarajan Committee of 1993 was constituted by the government to make recommendations in context with the disinvestment. The committee said: The units to be disinvested should be identified, and disinvestment could be made up to any level , except in defense and atomic energy, where the government should retain the majority holding in equity. Disinvestment should be a transparent process, duly protecting the rights of the workers. An autonomous body for the smooth functioning and monitoring of the disinvestment programme should be established. The Disinvestment Commission established in 1996 as an advisory body It suggested four modes of disinvestment, viz., trade sale, strategic sale, offer of shares, and closure or sale of assets. In its budget speech for 2000–01, the government emphasized that more emphasis would now be placed on the strategic sale of public sector enterprises. The disinvestment receipts for the financial year 2017-18 exceed Rs 1 lakh crore, which is higher than the figure of last year at Rs 46,250 crore. Government also launched BHARAT 22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) to meet the disinvestment targets. POST-REFORM PERIOD: Exploring Changes in Indian Economy Appraisal Rise in Growth Rate: The Indian economy has come out of its “ Hindu growth rate ” and clocked an average growth rate of 7-8 percent. Rise in Exports: India is the global leader in software exports. Surge in inflows of foreign investment Growth of Private Sector: The private sector entered into new areas and expanded production and employment Robust Performance of the Service Sector: with the onset of reforms, the share of the services sector went up to 44 percent in total GDP. Built-up of Foreign Exchange Reserves: India has about USD 480 billion as forex reserve as of May 2020 Failure Unlocking Agriculture’s Potential: Agriculture has not gained much; agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy and rural India. It needs greater focus to enhance productivity and make it a more profitable business. The problem of poverty still persists in the Indian economy . About 30 percent of the population still lives in poverty. Unemployment is on the rise; in rural areas, the problem of unemployment and underemployment is widespread and deeply entrenched. The policies of the new Indian economy were more beneficial to the skilled and trained workforce. Rural India is Still Neglected: About 70 percent of India lives in rural areas. People migrate to urban areas due to inadequate employment opportunities. The plight of agriculture workers has worsened ; agricultural workers and laborers continue to be the most backward and neglected class. Indian Economy: Understanding the Impact of the Green Revolution in Agriculture The Green Revolution in the Indian Economy is referred to as the process of increasing agricultural production by incorporating modern tools and techniques in agricultural practices. Indian Economy: Background of the Green Revolution in Agricultural Transformation At the time of its independence, India was predominantly an agricultural economy . And yet, the state of the Indian agricultural sector was dismal . A lack of investment, a dearth of technology, low yield per acre and many other problems plagued the industry. After 1947, India had to rebuild its economy . Over 75 percent of the population depended on agriculture in some way or another. But agriculture in India was faced with several structural and other problems. The productivity of grains was very low, along with fragmentation of landholding . India was still monsoon – dependent because of lack of irrigation and other infrastructure. So in 1965 , the government, with the help of Indian geneticist M.S. Swaminathan (the Father of the Green Revolution), launched the Green Revolution. The movement lasted from 1967 to 1978 and was a great success. Indian Economy: Features of the Green Revolution in Agricultural Changes Introduced high-yielding variety seeds in traditional agriculture in the Indian Economy. The Green Revolution in the Indian Economy at first focused on states with better infrastructure, such as Tamil Nadu and Punjab , due to rich irrigation facilities. During the second phase, the high-yielding variety seeds were given to other states and crops other than wheat were also included in the plan. The Green Revolution in the Indian Economy has improved the irrigation systems around farms in India. Commercial crops and cash crops such as cotton, jute, oilseeds, etc. were not part of the plan. Green revolution in India mainly emphasized on food grains such as wheat and rice. To enhance farm productivity, the green revolution increased the availability and use of fertilizers , weedicides , and pesticides to reduce any damage or loss to the crops. It also helped in promoting commercial farming in the country Introduction of machinery and technology like harvesters, drills, tractors, etc. facilitated mechanization of farming. Indian Economy: The First Green Revolution in Agricultural Transformation The high yielding varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice have been the key elements in the Indian green revolution in the Indian Economy. Though the term “green revolution” refers to wheat and rice, some agricultural scientists include maize , soybean and sugarcane where spectacular gains in yield have occurred. Indian Economy: Understanding the Components of the Green Revolution in Agriculture 1. INTRODUCTION OF HIGH YIELDING VARIETIES (HYV) In the 1960s, the average national yield of wheat was very low as compared to the wheat yields of agriculturally advanced countries. MS Swaminathan , (former Director General of ICAR) stressed the need for reorientation of the entire breeding programme of tall varieties. Norman E. Borlaug was invited from Mexico in 1963 by the GoI to assess the possibilities of using dwarf varieties in the Indian Economy. Borlaug recommended the feasibility of using semi-dwarf wheat of Mexican origin as the Agro-climatic conditions prevailing in India are similar to those in Mexico. On his recommendation, two semi-dwarf varieties of wheat, namely Lerma Rajo and Sonora-64 were chosen and were released for cultivation in irrigated fields. These varieties gave very high yields and brought about a revolution in wheat production. In 1970, Norman E. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel prize for the “Green Revolution” which also helped India. The important, high-yielding varieties responded favorably to fertilizer and irrigation. 2. Indian Economy: Exploring the Impact of Chemical Fertilizers and Pesticides in Agriculture Pesticides are chemicals which have been developed to kill or control organisms called pests, which are unwanted in agriculture. Nitrogenous fertilizers (N): Nitrogen containing fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea Nitrogenous fertilizers promote plant growth and are essential for food production. Potassium fertilizers (P): Potassium containing fertilizers such as potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate. Phosphate fertilizers (K): Phosphate containing fertilizers like ammonium phosphate, calcium dihydrogen phosphate (superphosphate). 3. MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURE Increase in productivity on large areas of land led to the idea of farm mechanization. To cope up with the shortage of agricultural labor, farm mechanization was the obvious choice for completing agricultural operations. Mechanization improves the efficiency of inputs and ensures the Indian economy of scale . 4. IRRIGATION HYVs usually require abundant water and hence irrigational facilities were a prerequisite for the green revolution in the Indian Economy. Wells (Dug and Tube): This kind of irrigation is widely practiced in plain regions of India. Over-exploitation of wells is well observed in Punjab-Haryana region. Canals: This is usually an elaborate and extensive irrigation Canal irrigation is well suited for regions with clayey soil because clayey soil prevents water percolation . It is mostly practiced in south India and Ganga-Yamuna region . River Lift Systems: Water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers. Mostly practiced in South India . Tanks: These are small storage reservoirs, which intercept and store the run-off of smaller catchment areas. Impact of Green Revolution on Indian Economy: Transforming Indian Agriculture in Simple Terms POSITIVE The Green Revolution in The Indian Economy has remarkably increased Agricultural Production . The biggest beneficiary of the revolution was wheat grain . Green Revolution in the Indian Economy increased the per hectare yield in case of wheat from 850 kg per hectare to an incredible 2281 kg/hectare in its early stage. India reached its way to self-sufficiency and was less dependent on imports. The production in the country was sufficient to meet normal and emergency demand. Rather than depending on the import of food grains from other countries, India started exporting its agricultural produce. There was a rise in rural employment . The tertiary industries created employment opportunities for the workforce. The adoption of new technology has also given boost to agricultural employment because of diverse job opportunities created by multiple cropping and shift towards hired workers – transportation, irrigation, food processing, marketing, etc. There has been more consistency with the annual harvest because the fields are worked in a similar way each year. New technology and modernization of agriculture have strengthened the linkages between agriculture and industry. It has helped to create numerous strains of plants that are resistant to disease and pests. It makes farmers more secure The Green Revolution in The Indian Economy majorly benefited the farmers of the country. Farmers not only survived but also prospered during the revolution. Their income saw a significant raise, which enabled them to shift from sustenance farming to commercial farming. NEGATIVE Retardation of agricultural growth due to inadequate irrigation cover, fragmentation of farm size, failure to evolve new technologies, inadequate use of technology, declining plan outlay, unbalanced use of inputs and weaknesses in credit delivery system. Regional dispersal of the evolution created regional inequalities . The benefits of the green revolution in The Indian Economy remained concentrated in the areas where the new technology was used. The benefits of the green revolution remained largely confined to wheat-growing areas for many years, limiting its impact on other regions and industries. Interpersonal inequalities between large and small scale farmers. Adverse effects on the distribution of patterns of income in rural areas. It led to widening the inter-regional and intra-regional disparities in income The new technologies introduced during the revolution called for substantial investments which were beyond the means of a majority of small farmers. Farmers with large farmlands continued to make greater absolute gains in income by reinvesting the earnings in farm and non-farm assets, purchasing land from the smaller cultivators, etc. Ecological cost of the green revolution in The Indian Economy is tremendous and unsustainable. The farmers are largely dependent on the market for the supply of inputs and for the demand for their products. Demand for agricultural credit has also increased as the new technology has increased the cash requirements of farmers. Poor farmers were not able to get loans easily. There has been displacement of agricultural labor by extensive agricultural mechanization, which has left them unemployed. The hybrid crops have also created environmental impacts like soil pollution and water pollution due to the excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. needed by these crops. CONCLUSION There are both positive and negative impacts of the Green Revolution In the Indian Economy on farmers. Due to the Green Revolution in the Indian Economy there was a considerable increase in food grains production, which was extremely necessary for farmers to increase production so that agriculture became part of the Indian Economy. Due to the Green Revolution in The Indian Economy, the agricultural sector of India is able to meet the increasing demand for food grains. However, now is the high time to bring about a green revolution that is also farmer-friendly.

    "content": "To prepare for INDIAN ECONOMY for any competitive exam, aspirants have to know about the Basics Of Money. IAS aspirants should thoroughly understand their meaning and application, as questions can be asked from this static portion of the IAS Syllabus in both the UPSC Prelims and the UPSC Mains exams. Basics Of Money is a commonly accepted medium of exchange. Money is something everyone agrees to trade stuff for, like buying things or paying back what you owe. It’s super easy to swap because everyone wants it, like gold or silver, making it the most popular thing to trade for other things. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course MONEY PART-1 Understanding the Basics of Money Money is a commonly accepted medium of exchange. Money is anything that can be generally accepted as payment for goods and services or settlement of debts. Money, as one of the most fundamental Basics of Money, is the most liquid (it is easy to sell in the market like gold, silver, etc.) of all assets in the sense that it is universally acceptable and hence can be exchanged for other commodities very easily. Basics of Money: Understanding its Functions in Economic Transactions Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Primary Function Medium of Exchange Measure of Value Secondary Function Store of Value Standard of Deferred Payments PRIMARY FUNCTIONS Measure of Value: Money, as one of the fundamentals Basics of Money, serves as a common measure of value or unit of account so, the relative comparison of goods is possible. This is possible because of Divisibility & Fungibility of money . Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Divisible: Money, as a key aspect of the Basics of Money, can be easily divided into small increments so that it can match commodity values more precisely. For example, 4 notes of Rs.500 have same value as 1 note of Rs.2000 Fungible: Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. For example, 1 note of Rs.500 can buy same amount of good as the other note of Rs.500 Medium of Exchange (transaction): People can easily exchange goods and services with money. This is possible because money is: Readily acceptable as it is legal tender . Durable as it remains functional for a long time Recognizable by authorities and people as well. Hard to Counterfeit and duplicate. DERIVATIVE FUNCTIONS Deferred Payment: Money, as a fundamental component of the Basics of Money, also serves as a standard mode of deferred payments. Time value of Money , for instance, Credit card, EMI etc. If a loan is taken today, it can be paid back in future using money. Transfer of Value: money has the same value throughout the country and its value is transferable. Store of Value: It can be kept as savings (in a bank account) and could be used for investment purposes. Example: buying property. Its storage costs are also considerably lower. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 3. EVOLUTION OF MONEY Barter system Commodity money Metallic money Paper money (Fiat money) Bank money Virtual (Crypto) currency 3.1 Basics of Money: Examining the Shortcomings of the Barter System The Barter system is an exchange of goods for other goods. The exchange of commodities without the mediation of money is called Barter Exchange. It suffers from a problem of double coincidence of wants . The barter system does not provide for the direct purchase of goods since there was no common unit of account and medium of exchange (Money), which are fundamental aspects of the basics of money. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes POSITIVES NEGATIVES Simplest in form No foreign exchange regime No concentration of wealth Double coincidence of wants was a must Exchange of perishable goods No saving capital No circular flow of income No Divisibility or Fungibility of the same value. Basics of Money: A Comparative Analysis of Barter System and Money PARAMETER BARTER SYSTEM MONEY Perishable Problem with perishable goods so they cannot be stored for a long time. Example: Potatoes, rice. It is not perishable so it can be stored. It will remain intact for a long time. Example: Coins and paper currency Double coincidence of want Double coincidence of wants is a must to initiate a transaction. Not needed to initiate a transaction. Divisibility Divisibility is difficult High divisibility, money can be divided into small increments that can be used in exchange Storage cost It has a high storage cost given the perishable nature of commodities. Comparatively low storage cost. Universal acceptability N o universal acceptability Money facilitates exchanges by acting as a commonly acceptable medium of exchange Deferred payment Not possible Temporary postponements of payment possible. Convertibility to other Commodities Difficult Easy to convert into other commodities Exchangeability Poor on account of exchangeability Money can be exchanged easily Liquidity P oor liquidity High Liquidity (Easily available and tradable in any market) Unit of Account Not act as a standard unit of account Money acts as a standard unit of account. Fungibility Less fungible High fungibility (replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable) Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching DIFFICULTIES UNDER BARTER SYSTEM Difficulties under Barter System Double coincidence of wants Lack of information about product quality Impossibility of subdivisions No unit of account to measure the worth of good DOUBLE COINCIDENCE OF WANTS It is an economic phenomenon where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they exchange these items directly without any monetary medium. Example: The shoemaker wants to buy wheat and the farmer wants to buy shoes so they both can exchange their commodities. 3.2 Basics of Money: Exploring Commodity Currency Commodity Money: It is money whose value comes from a commodity of which it is made. Objects with Intrinsic Value: Commodity money consists of objects having value or use in themselves (intrinsic value) as well as their value in buying goods. Example: Gold not only used as medium of exchange but also for making jewellery as well. IndiaàCowries: These were used to make exchanges during earlier times. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course PROBLEMS OF COMMODITY MONEY- Face Value was not the same throughout the region. Generally commodities used were perishable in nature. Generally commodities are bulky to carry No fungibility (replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable) and divisibility 3.3. Basics of Money: Exploring Metallic Currency and Intrinsic Value Superior Metal: It is money made up of pure and superior metals like gold and silver. Face Value and Intrinsic Value: This type of metallic money has a face value just equal to its intrinsic value. The value inscribed on the coins is called face value of money. The value of metal used to mint the coin is called intrinsic value. Forged in Gold (Muhr): High value (Because gold supply was relatively lower than silver and copper.) Forged in Silver (Rupaiya): Moderate value Forged in Copper/ Bronze (Dam, Paisa): For day to day purchases Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes FACE VALUE INTRINSIC VALUE The face value is the legally defined value of the coin relative to other units of currency. Intrinsic value refers to the market value of the constituent metal within a coin. Fiat money has a face value. Fiat money does not have intrinsic value. Face value cannot be derived from selling of constituent metal/currency itself. Intrinsic value can be derived from selling of constituent metal itself. Positives of Metallic Money Negatives of Metallic Money Metallic money has intrinsic value and it has non-perishable nature and can be stored for a long time. Bulky to carry and so difficult to move. Items used as money can be easily divided into small increments so that it can match commodity values more precisely. Smuggling for intrinsic value. Fungible–Replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable. High storage cost. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 3.4 Basics of Money: Exploring Fiat Currency and Central Bank Control Legal Tender Status: Paper money acts as money (Legal tender) because it are guaranteed by the national governments. Fiat money is legally recognized to settle all debts & payments within territorial jurisdiction. Fiat Money and its Role: Fiat money gives central banks greater control over the economy because they can control how much money is printed. Representative Money: When fiat money is backed by gold or silver standard, it’s called “representative money”, and when the central bank promises “to pay bearer the sum of this many rupees”, currency becomes an “anonymous bearer bond with zero interest”. Example: US dollar, Indian Rupee, Euro, etc. Issuing Authority for Fiat Money in India: In India, two entities issue fiat money Government of India: under the coinage act 1909 issues all coins and Rs.1 note; while RBI: RBI Act 1934 empowers RBI to issue the remaining bank notes and RBI central board is empowered to make recommendations to the government of India to withdraw any notes from circulation. This is called “Demonetization” and was done thrice in India after independence. Non-Fiat Money: Understanding Monetary Instruments Beyond Government Backing Money without government legal backing Superstores plastic coins, cards & coupons Shares, Bonds, Debentures, G-Sec, T-bill DD, Cheques, Credit Card, ATM card Bitcoin & other Digital currency PROBLEMS OF FIAT MONEY Induced Currency Devaluation: Reduction in value of money by monetary policies leads to over printing of currency which could result in inflationary pressures, loss of purchasing power for consumers, and ultimately economic instability. Still Bulky to carry, so reduces its movability Security Risks: Risk of theft and prone to counterfeit (duplicate/fake currency) Challenges with Divisibility in Currency: Money cannot be easily divided into small increments so that it can match commodity values more precisely, leading to rounding off problems. Example: Petrol pumps are not returning 60 paise per customer due to change problems. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Hyper-inflation is a situation where inflation rises at an extremely fast rate. The rate of inflation can increase from 50 times to 300 times. 3.5 Bank Money: Exploring Central Bank-Backed Financial Instruments Backed by the Central bank of the country viz. Cheque, Bank Draft, NEFT, RTGS Credit cards & Debit cards BENEFITS OF BANK MONEY Transactions could be settled on the spot , resulting in time saving. Option of the Deferred payment Easy to transfer over long distance Exact amount can be transferred (No change problem) Hard to counterfeit or make duplicate Can be freezed if the card is stolen via. KYC (Know Your Customer) norms Legally recognized for high value payment Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Deferred Payment: It is a temporary postponement of the payment of an outstanding bill or debt, usually involving repayment by instalments. 3.6 Virtual Money: Exploring Unregulated Digital Curre ncy Definition: Virtual currency is a type of unregulated digital currency that is only available in electronic form. Decentralization: Virtual currency is currency held within the blockchain network that is not controlled by a centralized banking authority. Storage and Transactions: It is stored and transacted only through designated software, mobile or computer applications, or through dedicated digital wallets, and the transactions occur over the internet through secure, dedicated networks. Relationship to Digital Currency and Cryptocurrencies: Virtual currency is considered to be a subset of the digital currency group, which also includes cryptocurrencies, which exist within the blockchain network. Distinction from Digital Currency: Virtual currency is different from digital currency since digital currency is simply currency issued by a bank in digital form. 3.7 Fiduciary Money: Understanding Trust-Based Currency Definition: Fiduciary money is money which is accepted as a medium of exchange because of the trust between the payer and the payee. Examples: Cheques , Banknotes , etc. 3.8 Credit Money: Exploring Value-Based Currency Definition: Credit Money refers to that money, in which money value is more than the commodity value. Money value > Commodity value. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Q. Consider the following liquid assets: (UPSC 2013) Demand deposits with the banks Time deposits with the banks Savings deposits with the banks Currency The correct sequence of these assets in decreasing order of liquidity is 1-4-3-2 4-3-2-1 2-3-1-4 4-1-3-2 Money is the most liquid of all assets. Liquidity Order is as following – Currency Demand deposits in Banks Savings deposits in Banks Term (Time) deposits in Banks Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 4. CREATION OF MONEY Money Supply: It is all the currency and other liquid instruments in a country’s economy on the date measured. Money creation is the process leading to an increase in the money supply. Money creation by banks can be understood through a straightforward process. Let’s break it down using simple terms and examples: Deposits and Lending: When you deposit money in a bank, the bank does not just keep it in a vault. Instead, it lends a significant portion of this money to others who need loans. Example: if you deposit Rs 1000, the bank might lend Rs 900 to someone else. Creating New Deposits: When the bank lends money, it doesn’t give out cash. It opens a new deposit account in the borrower’s name. If the bank lends Rs 900 to someone, this person now has a deposit account with Rs 900. Thus, the total money supply in the economy increases by this new deposit. Money Supply Increase: Originally, the money supply was just your Rs 1000 deposit. After the loan, the total money supply is your Rs 1000 deposit plus the new Rs 900 deposit, making it Rs 1900 in total . The money supply is roughly composed of both cash and deposits that can be used almost as easily as cash. Money supply will change if the value of any of its components such as Consumer Unit (CU), Demand Draft (DD) or Time Deposits changes. For simplicity, use the most liquid definition of money, viz. M1 = CU + DD, as the measure of money supply in the economy. Various actions of the monetary authority, RBI, and commercial banks are responsible for changes in the values of these items. The preference of the public for holding cash balances vis- ́a-vis deposits in banks also affects the money supply. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 4.1 Basics of Money: Exploring the Currency Deposit Ratio and Money Creation Currency Deposit Ratio (cdr): It is the ratio of money held by the public in currency to that they hold in bank deposits (cdr= CU/DD) It reflects people’s preference for liquidity . It is a purely behavioural parameter which depends, among other things, on the seasonal pattern of expenditure. Example: cdr increases during the festive season as people convert deposits to cash balance for meeting extra expenditure during such periods. 4.2 Basics of Money: Understanding Reserve Deposit Ratio and Monetary Policy Reserve Deposit Ratio (rdr) is the proportion of the total deposits commercial banks keep as reserves. Reserve money consists of two things – Vault cash in banks and Deposits of commercial banks with RBI. Banks hold a part of the money that people keep in their bank deposits as reserve money and loan out the rest to various investment projects. Banks use this reserve to meet the demand for cash by account holders. However, RBI requires commercial banks to keep reserves in order to ensure that banks have a safe cushion of assets to draw on when account holders want to be paid. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching RBI’s Monetary Policy Instruments RBI uses various policy instruments to bring forth a healthy rdr in commercial banks. Cash Reserve Ratio(CRR): The first instrument is the CRR which specifies the fraction of their deposits that banks must keep with RBI. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): There is another tool called Statutory Liquidity Ratio which requires the banks to maintain a given fraction of their total demand and time deposits in the form of specified liquid assets. Bank Rate: Apart from these ratios RBI uses a certain interest rate called the Bank Rate to control the value of rdr. Commercial banks can borrow money from RBI at the bank rate when they run short of reserves. A high bank rate makes such borrowing from RBI costly and, in effect, encourages the commercial banks to maintain a healthy rdr. Q. When the Reserve Bank of India announces an increase of the Cash Reserve Rate, what does it mean? [CSE -2010] The commercial banks will have less money to lend The Reserve Bank of India will have less money to lend The Union Government will have less money to lend The commercial banks will have more money to lend Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 4.3 Basics of Money: Understanding the Role of Commercial Banks in Financial Intermediation Commercial Banks accept deposits from the public and lend out this money to interest earning investment projects. The rate of interest offered by the bank to deposit holders is called the ‘ borrowing rate ’ and the rate at which banks lend out their reserves to investors is called the ‘ lending rate ’. The difference between the two rates, called ‘ spread ’, is the profit that is appropriated by the banks. Deposits are broadly of two types: Demand Deposits: payable by the banks on demand from the account holder, Example: Current and savings account deposits, and Time Deposits: which have a fixed period to maturity, Example: fixed deposits. Q. Which of the following is not included in the assets of a commercial bank in India? (a) Advances (b) Deposits (c) Investments (d) Money at call and short notice Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Function of Commercial Banks Primary Accepting deposit and Providing loans Secondary Collection and payment of various items e.g. Cheques, Bills Purchase and sell of securities & remittance of money Purchase and sell of foreign exchange Acting as executors and trustees of wills & underwriting of shares Lockers facility & Travellers’ cheque and letter of credit Q . The main functioning of the banking system is to________ (CDS-2013) Accept deposits and provide credit Accept deposits and subsidies provide credit and subsidies accept deposits, provide credit and subsidies Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 5. VALUE OF MONEY By value of money, we mean the purchasing power of money. Purchasing Power is the amount of goods or services that can be purchased with a unit of currency. When the value of money rises i.e. its purchasing power increases, the general price level falls and vice versa. This means the value of money is inverse of the general price level. For instance, at a point of time, Rs. 10 were able to purchase 2 packets of biscuits, but on other times it can buy only one packet because of erosion of purchase power of that currency. This also results in increased purchase power of biscuit packet, it became Rs.7. 6. DEMAND FOR MONEY Money is the most liquid of all assets in the sense that it is universally acceptable and hence can be exchanged for other commodities very easily. On the other hand, it has an opportunity cost. If, instead of holding on to a certain cash balance, you put the money in fixed deposits in some bank you can earn interest on that money. Total demand for money in an economy is composed of transaction demand and speculative demand. Demand for money balance is thus often referred to as liquidity preference. People desire to hold money balance broadly for following motives- Transaction Motive Precautionary Motive Speculative Motive Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 6.1 Transaction Motive: Understanding the Demand for Money in Daily Transactions The principal motive for holding money is to purchase goods and services in day to day life and carry out transactions The transaction demand for money in the economy is a fraction of the total volume of transactions in the economy over the unit period of time. The total value of annual transactions in an economy includes transactions in all intermediate goods and services and is clearly much greater than the nominal GDP. An increase in nominal GDP implies an increase in the total value of transactions. 6.2 Speculative Motive: Exploring the Demand for Money in Investment Decisions When people wish to hold money rather than buying assets/bonds/risky investments . An individual may hold her wealth in the form of landed property, bullion, bonds, money Different people have different expectations regarding the future movements in the market rate of interest based on their private information regarding the economy. Speculative demand for money is inversely related to the rate of interest can be thought of as an opportunity cost or ‘price’ of holding money balance. Example: If interest rates are high, and people expect interest rates to fall, then there is likely to be greater demand for buying bonds and less demand for holding money. If interest rates fall, then the price of bonds will rise.

As receipts and payments cannot be perfectly foreseen, people hold precautionary balances to minimize the potential loss arising from a contingency. The precautionary demand is dependent on the size of income , the availability of credit, and the rate of interest. 7. OPPORTUNITY COST OF MONEY Definition: Opportunity cost refers to a benefit that a person could have received, but gave up, to take another course of action. Stated differently, an opportunity cost represents an alternative given up when a decision is made. Opportunity cost is also called the economic cost . Opportunity Cost = Return of Most Lucrative Option – Return of Chosen Option. As per microeconomics, opportunity cost is zero for free goods such as Air and common goods such as fish / grazing land. For public goods such as street lights and defence, opportunity cost is involved (Government could have spent that much money on street lights rather than on military). Opportunity cost is not zero in case of public goods . If a commodity is provided free to the public by the government, then: Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching The opportunity cost is zero. The opportunity cost is ignored. The opportunity cost is transferred from the consumers of the product to the taxpaying public. The opportunity cost is transferred from the consumers of the product to the government. 8. DETERMINANTS OF MONEY DEMAND Prevalent Price Level: High interest rate or price level will reduce demand for money and vice versa. Inflation Level: In an economy, Inflation level reduces demand for money because people prefer to save instead of expenditure because of price rise. Real Income (Real GDP): Real income is how much money an individual or entity makes after accounting for inflation. Disposable Income: Higher the disposable income, there will be higher tendency to spend more. Innovation level in an economy. 9. MONEY SUPPLY (MONETARY AGGREGATES) Definition: The supply of money is a total stock of money in circulation among the public at a particular point of time. Measures of Money Supply: The measures of money supply in India are classified into four categories M1, M2, M3 and M4 along with M0. The classification of money supply was introduced in April 1977 by Reserve Bank of India. The term ‘the supply of money’ is synonymous with such terms as ‘ money stock’, ‘stock of money’, ‘money supply’ and ‘quantity of money’. The supply of money at any moment is the total amount of money in the economy. The supply of money is the product of Money Multiplier (m) and the amount of high-powered money or the reserve money. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Q. Which of the following measures would result in an increase in the money supply in the economy? [CSE -2012] Purchase of government securities from the public by the Central Bank Deposit of currency in commercial banks by the public Borrowing by the government from the Central Bank Sale of government securities to the public by the Central Bank Select the correct answer using the codes given below: 1 only 2 and 4 only 1 and 3 2, 3 and 4 9.1 Reserve Money (M0): Understanding the Foundation of Monetary Base Reserve Money (M0): It is also known as High-Powered Money , monetary base, base money etc. Reserve Money is the monetary base of the economy. Reserve Money (M0) = Currency in circulation + Bankers’ Deposits with the RBI + ‘Other’ deposits with the RBI. ‘Other’ deposits with RBI comprise mainly: deposits of quasi-government; other financial institutions including primary dealers, balances in the accounts of foreign Central Banks and Governments, Accounts of international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 9.2 Narrow Money (M1): Understanding Highly Liquid Monetary Assets In banking terminology, M1 is called narrow money as it is highly liquid and banks cannot run their lending programmes with this money. M1 = Currency with the Public + Demand Deposits with the Banking System + ‘Other’ deposits with the RBI. M2 = M1 + Savings Deposits of Post-office Savings Banks 9.3 Broad Money (M3): Understanding the Basis for Bank Lending Programs The money component M3 is called broad money. With this money (which lies with banks for a known period) banks run their lending programmes. M3 = M1 + Time Deposits with the Banking System. M4 = M3 + All deposits with Post Office Savings Banks (excluding National Savings Certificates). M3 and M4 are known as broad money . Q. Consider the following: Currency with the public Demand deposits with banks Time deposits with banks Which of these are included in Broad Money (M3) 1 and 2 1 and 3 2 and 3 1, 2 and 3 Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Q. Following are some components of money supply in India: Currency with the public Aggregate demand deposits with banks Aggregate time deposits with banks ‘Other’ deposits with the Reserve Bank of India Which of the aforesaid items are components of narrow money (M1) in India? 1, 2 and3 2 and 4 only 1, 2 and 4 1and 4 only HIGHEST LIQUIDITY TO LOWEST LIQUIDITY M1 ⇒ CURRENCY + DEMAND DEPOSITS + OTHER DEPOSITS M2 ⇒ M1 + POST OFFICE (ONLY SAVINGS) M 3⇒ M1 + TIME DEPOSITS M4 ⇒ M3 + POST OFFICE (TOTAL) Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 9.4 High-Powered Money: Understanding the Monetary Base The total liability of the monetary authority of the country, RBI, is called the monetary base or high powered money. It consists of currency (notes and coins in circulation with the public and vault cash of commercial banks) and deposits held by the Government of India and commercial banks with RBI. If a member of the public produces a currency note to RBI the latter must pay her value equal to the figure printed on the note. Similarly, the deposits are also refundable by RBI on demand from deposit-holders. These items are claims which the general public, government or banks have on RBI and hence are considered to be the liability of RBI. In general, therefore, this liability must be backed by an equal value of assets consisting mainly, gold and foreign exchange reserves. In practice, however, most countries have adopted a ‘minimum reserve system’ By definition, money supply is equal to currency plus deposits – M = CU + DD = (1 + cdr)DD where, cdr = CU/DD. Assume, for simplicity, that the treasury deposit of the Government with RBI is zero. High powered money then consists of currency held by the public and reserves of the commercial banks, which include vault cash and banks’ deposits with RBI. Thus, H=CU+R=cdr.DD+rdr.DD=(cdr + rdr)DD The currency issued by the central bank is called ‘high power money’ because it is generally backed by supporting ‘reserves’ and its value is guaranteed by the government and it is the source of all other forms of money. In India, there are two sources of high power money supply: RBI Government of India Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Reserve Money: The RBI issues currency notes of rupees 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 2000 denominations which RBI calls as the ‘Reserve Money’. Notes and Coins: The RBI issues currency of one rupee notes and coins including coins of smaller denominations on behalf of the Government of India which accounts for around 2 per cent of the total high power money. RESERVE BANK OF INDIA LIABILITIES ASSETS Notes in circulation Foreign currency assets Notes held in banking department Bill purchases and discounts Deposits Collaterals by commercial banks Other liabilities Loans and advances Governemtn securities Developmental Securities Gold coin bullion Supply of money remaining the same when there is an increase in demand for money, there will be (CSE-2013) A fall in the level of prices An increase in the rate of interest A decrease in the rate of interest An increase in the level of income and employment Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 9.5 Minimum Reserve System: Ensuring Adequate Reserve Backing for Currency Issuance Under the Minimum Reserve System, the RBI must maintain a minimum reserve of Rs 200 crore. This includes Rs 115 crore in gold (coins or bullion) and the remaining amount in foreign currencies . Against this reserve, the RBI is empowered to issue currency to any extent. This has been followed since 1956 and is known as the Minimum Reserve System (MRS). 10. MONEY MULTIPLIER Definition: The money multiplier is the maximum amount of broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio. Its value is determined in ratio of total money supply to the stock of the high-powered money in an economy. M: stock of money, H: stock of high powered money Clearly, its value is greater than 1. The Currency Deposit Ratio (cdr) and Reserve Deposit Ratio (rdr) plays an important role in determining money multipliers. cdr = C/DD ratio of the total deposit kept by commercial banks. rdr is the proportion of the total deposit kept by commercial banks. The money multiplier (M) is the inverse of the Reserve Requirement (R) M = 1/R Monetary base is the sum of currency in circulation and bank reserves. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Q. The money multiplier in an economy increases with which one of the following? Increase in the cash reserve ratio Increase in the banking habit of the population Increase in the statutory liquidity ratio Increase in the population of the country VELOCITY OF MONEY CIRCULATION Definition: The number of times a unit of money changes hands during the unit period is called the velocity of circulation of money. It is the average number of times money passes from one hand to another, during a given time period. Example: you bought a pen worth Rs.10 from the shopkeeper, he uses the same 10 rupee note to buy Coca-Colaàthen same currency note performs the function of TWENTY Rupees. This is called “Velocity of money” 11. Factors Affecting Velocity of Money: Understanding Influential Variables Income Distribution: Poor people immediately use their money. So, money in the hands of poor money has a higher velocity. Business Cycle: During booming period, production of goods and services increases, so there is higher demand for goods and services which leads to higher economic transactions so, higher velocity and vice versa If more people use EMI loans for purchase , it will result in higher velocity of money. Developed countries have higher velocity of money, because of higher spending patterns and confidence in Government social-security. A boom refers to a period of increased commercial activity within a business, market, industry, or economy as a whole. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 12. Factors Affecting Money Supply: Understanding Influential Elements Monetary Base: A monetary base is the total amount of a currency that is either in general circulation in the hands of the public or in the commercial bank deposits held in the central bank’s reserves. If there is more reserve money in the system, money supply would increase and vice versa. Monetary Policy: RBI’s dear (tight) money policy reduces money supply in the market. However, RBI’s cheap money policy increases money supply in the market. People’s Choice: When people deposit a higher portion of their income in banks, it results in decreased money supply. Fiscal Policy: Fiscal policy deals with the government policy concerning changes in the taxation and expenditure overheads and components. Business Cycle: In boom cycle, money supply increases and in depression cycle, the money supply decreases. Money supply will decrease if: – Higher Taxation: as it will reduce money in the market. Sale of Government Securities (G-sec): People will purchase this, so it will reduce money supply. Deficit Financing: by the government will increase money supply, so the level of inflation also increases. The business cycle is fluctuations in economic activity that an economy experiences over a period of time. Business cycles are generally measured using the rise and fall in the real gross domestic product (GDP) or the GDP adjusted for inflation. It is also known as the economic cycle or trade cycle . Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 13. Determinants of Money Supply: Key Factors Influencing Monetary Expansion Reserve Ratio: higher reserve ratio (e.g. CRR, SLR, Repo rate) reduces the available money with banks to lend, so it reduces money supply and vice versa. The Level of Bank Reserves: higher bank reserves reduces the available money with the bank. Public’s Desire to Hold Currency and Deposits: higher deposits by the public reduces money supply in the market. Money Multiplier: this refers to how an initial deposit can lead to a bigger final increase in the total money supply. Interest Rates: higher interest rates discourage the borrowing by people from the bank. So it reduces the money supply. Q. With reference to inflation in India, find correct statement: Controlling the inflation in India is the responsibility of the Government of India only The Reserve Bank of India has no role in controlling the inflation Decreased money circulation helps in controlling the inflation Increased money circulation helps in controlling the inflation Enroll now for UPSC Online Course WHY IS SAVINGS/CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE TREATED AS MONEY? This is because to settle a transaction, you can draw a cheque against these accounts. These deposits are also called demand deposits because they are payable by the bank on demand from the account holder. However, cheques drawn on savings or current accounts can be refused by anyone as a mode of payment. Thus they are not legal tenders . This is because cheques (or drafts) are just an instrument for transacting but it has no value of its own. 14. Credit Creation in India: Understanding the Mechanisms of Credit Expansion A situation in which banks make more loans available to consumers and businesses, which results in creation of credit in the overall economy. Credit is created by commercial banks in two ways: Advancing loans By purchasing securities. Banks maintain some part of deposits as liquid cash, termed as cash reserve. This is a minimum requirement as specified by RBI. The excess or surplus is given out as loans and advances. When giving a loan, banks open deposit accounts in the name of the borrower. This is known as secondary or derivative deposit. The deposit left after giving out loans is known as credit multiplier. Thus, credit is created from secondary deposits. Credit multiplier indicates the number of times primary deposits multiply and is the inverse of CRR. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Primary deposits refer to that sum of money which is deposited in bank accounts while opening such accounts. Secondary deposit or derivative deposit is the deposit of credit created by the bank to the borrower while lending a loan. TYPES OF CREDIT CREATION The need for credit comes from the demand and supply side of the economy. The consumers of the demand side require credit to acquire simple assets like consumer durables. The demand for credit from supply side corporate houses arises due to their needs for long-term investments. Types of loans: Commercial Loans: Loans which are given to the supply side. These are given for 2 purposes: For acquiring fixed assets For maintaining the business Individual Loans: Loans which are given to demand side. These are given for: Consumption Acquiring durables Installment Credit: Credit amount is decided in advance and the amount is disbursed either in stages or all at once. It is however, repaid in installments. Operating Credit: This is given to meet the daily credit requirements for operations. Banks decide the credit limit and provide a current account from which money can be withdrawn. Receivable Finance: Credit is in form of bills of finance. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Types of loans Receivable finance Commercial loans Individual loans Installment credit Operating credit MERITS Banks are able to diversify the operational risks with the help of credit creation. The loans and advances are generally done from excess or surplus reserves. This money which is lying passive joins the active process of credit creation. DEMERITS It is directly dependent on the volume of excess reserves available with the banks. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): CRR is the quantum which banks should keep with RBI as a safety measure. The minimum cash limit of the bank varies from 3-15%. Any increase in CRR leads to less availability of the credit. Risk: Averse nature of customers which makes them keep some cash with them for emergencies while banks prefer giving more loans to keep credit creation going. Periods of economic recessions call for less loan demands from the customers. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 15. MONETARY POLICY OF RBI Monetary policy refers to all those operations, which are used to control the money supply in the economy. RBI reviews its monetary policy every two months (Six times in a year). The RBI implements the monetary policy through open market operations, bank rate policy, CRR, SLR, reserve system, credit control policy, moral persuasion etc. 15.1 Objectives of Monetary Policy: Ensuring Economic Stability and Growth To maintain economic and financial stability by targeting a healthy inflation range. To ensure adequate financial resources for the purpose of development. Ensuring price stability in the market by maintaining optimum inflation level. Adequate flow of credit to productive sectors.

Monetary Policy Committee (MPC): Framework and Composition Monetary policy refers to the credit control measures adopted by the central bank of a country. RBI is the sole monetary authority which decides the supply of money in the economy. MPC is a statutory body created under Monetary Policy Framework Agreement 2015 between the RBI and Government in 2016 MPC is entrusted with the responsibility of fixing the benchmark repo rate (policy rate) required to contain inflation as defined in the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement.

Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes INFLATION TARGETING It is a monetary policy where a central bank follows an explicit target for the inflation rate for the medium-term and announces this inflation target to the public. The Government of India has notified a medium-term inflation target of 4 %, with a band of +/- 2 % 16.1 Objectives of MPC: Promoting Economic Stability and Growth Price Stability: for promoting economic development through ensuring optimum inflation level, which will drive economic growth in the long run. Controlled Expansion of Bank Credit: with special attention to seasonal requirements (E.g. for agricultural purposes) for credit without affecting the output. Promotion of Fixed Investment: to increase the productivity of investment by restraining non-essential fixed investment. Promotion of Exports and Food Procurement Operations: by paying special attention in order to boost exports and facilitate trade. It is an independent objective of monetary policy. Desired Distribution of Credit: Monetary policy decides over the specified percentage of credit that is to be allocated to the priority sector and small borrowers. Equitable Distribution of Credit: to all sectors of the economy and all social and economic classes of people.

Financial Liquidity: Managing Short-Term Financial Resources Defintion: Liquidity refers to the amount of liquid assets that are available to pay expenses and debts as they become due. It is the availability of cash or cash equivalents to meet short-term operating needs. Banks leverage the deposits for lending in the economy which is known as ‘ credit creation ’ by banks. This credit creation is almost like fresh money injected in the economy and contributes to inflationary pressures. Liquidity in the economy should strike a balance between requirements of growth and at the same time keep the prices under check. Managing liquidity is a major aspect of the RBI functions. Money deposited in the bank is a source of liquidity . Money deposited could either be ‘demand’ deposits (payable by the bank on demand by a customer. Like, money retained in your savings account in the bank can be withdrawn by you at any time) or, ‘time’ deposits (can be withdrawn after a fixed period only like fixed deposits). Both demand as well as time deposits are the liabilities of the bank as the bank has to pay it back to the customer. These demand and time liabilities of the banking system are the source of increasing liquidity. 18. Liquidity Trap: Economic Conditions and Consumer Behavior A liquidity trap is when monetary policy becomes ineffective due to very low interest rates combined with consumers who prefer to save rather than invest in higher-yielding bonds or other investments. A liquidity trap means consumers’ preference for liquid assets (cash) is greater than the rate at which the quantity of money is growing. While a liquidity trap is a function of economic conditions, it is also psychological since consumers are making a choice to hoard cash instead of choosing higher-paying investments because of a negative economic outlook. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 18.1 Reasons for Liquidity Trap: Factors Contributing to Economic Inactivity Expectations of deflation by the public Preference for Saving: Liquidity traps occur during periods of recessions and a gloomy economic outlook. Credit Crunch: Banks lost significant sums of money in buying sub-prime debt, which defaulted. Therefore, they are seeking to improve their balance sheets by restricted lending activities. Banks don’t pass Base Rate cuts onto consumers Ineffective monetary policy transmission Unwillingness to Hold Bonds: If interest rates are zero, investors will expect interest rates to rise sometime. If interest rates rise, the price of bonds falls. 19. Various Currency Terms: Understanding Currency Classification 19.1 HARD CURRENCY It is the international currency in which the highest faith is shown and is needed by every economy. It is the strongest currency of the world, one which has a high level of liquidity. Basically, the economy with the highest as well as highly diversified exports, that are compulsive imports for other countries (high-level technology, defence products, lifesaving medicines and petroleum products) will also create high demand for its currency in the world and becomes the hard currency. It is always scarce. Meanwhile, by late 2015, the IMF allowed the SDR to be denominated in the Chinese ‘Yuan’ –paving the way for a new hard currency to be implemented in 2016. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 19.2 SOFT CURRENCY A term used in the foreign exchange market denotes the currency that is easily available in any economy in its forex market. For example, rupee is a soft currency in the Indian forex market. It is basically the opposite term for hard currency. 19.3 HOT CURRENCY Hot currency is a term of the forex market and is a temporary name for any hard currency . Due to certain reasons, if a hard currency is exiting an economy at a fast pace for the time, the hard currency is known to be hot. As in the case of the Southeast Asian crisis , the US dollar had become hot. 19.4 HEATED CURRENCY A term used in the forex market to denote the domestic currency which is under enough pressure (heat) of depreciation due to a hard currency’s high tendency to exiting the economy (since it has become hot). It is also known as ‘ currency under heat ’ or ‘ under hammering’ . Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 19.5 CHEAP CURRENCY A term first used by the economist M. Keynes (1930s). If a government starts re-purchasing its bonds before their maturities (at full-maturity prices) the money which flows into the economy is known as the cheap currency, also called cheap money. In the banking industry, it means a period of comparatively lower/softer interest rates regime . 19.6 DEAR CURRENCY This term was popularised by economists in the early 1930s to show the opposite of the cheap currency. When a government issues bonds, the money which flows from the public to the government or the money in the economy in general is called dear currency, also called as dear money. In the banking industry, it means a period of comparatively higher/costlier interest rates regime. 19.7 HELICOPTER MONEY It is a hypothetical concept put forward by the economist, Milton Friedman . This involves the central bank of the country printing currency notes and distributing it to the people free of cost . The idea here is to promote demand in the economy during recession. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 20. Currency in India: Historical Overview In India, the paper currency was first issued during British East India Company rule. The first paper currency issued in India was the Rs. 1 note. The first paper notes were issued by the private banks such as Bank of Hindustan and the presidency banks during the late 18th century. 21. Currency Circles in India: Historical Context After the 1861 act, the Government of India had the monopoly to issue paper notes in India. The lack of mobility, lack of development and lack of education resulted in a major issue in redemption of these notes. Consequently, there were only some areas (such as major cities and nearby areas) in various parts of the country, where the paper notes of the Indian government were legal tenders. These areas were called “ Currency Circles ”. 22. Currency Controller in India: Transition to RBI Authority Section 22 of the RBI Act 1934 provided that RBI has the sole right to issue Bank notes of all denominations. Thus, on 1 April 1935 , the currency function moved from Controller of Currency to RBI. Today, the Reserve Bank is responsible for the design, production and overall management of the nation’s currency, with the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 23. Decimalization of Coinage in India: Transition to the Paisa System During time of independence, the basic unit of Indian currency was 1 Rupee which could be divided into 16 Annas or 64 pice (pice was old spelling of paise) This 16 Anna or 64 Pice structure remained till 1957 , when decimalization of the coinage was done. Henceforth, spelling of “pice” was changed to “Paisa” and 1 Rupee was divided into 100 Paise. This is called Decimalization of Coinage and it took place in 1957. The 100th part of Rupee was now called Naya Paisa. The term “naya” was dropped in 1964. 24. Role of RBI Regarding Coins in India: Distribution as Agent of the Government The distribution of coins is undertaken by RBI as an agent of the Government, (coins are minted by the Government and not by RBI). However, the RBI is the only source of legal tender money because the distribution of one-rupee notes and coins and small coins all over the country is undertaken by the Reserve Bank as an agent of the government. 25. Current Paper Notes in Circulation in India: Denominations and Issuance At present, paper currency notes in India are issued in the denomination of Rs.5, Rs.10, Rs.20, Rs.50, Rs.100, Rs.200, Rs.500 and Rs.2,000. The printing of Rs. 1 and Rs. 2 denominations has been discontinued, though the notes in circulation are valid as per the Coinage Act 2011. RBI has been authorized to issue notes of Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10000 also. In fact, as per RBI act, RBI can issue any note of any denomination but not exceeding Rs. 10,000. The notes denomination is notified by the Government and RBI acts accordingly. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 26. Signature on Currency Notes in India: Authority and Signatories Under Section 22 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, RBI has sole right to issue currency notes of various denominations except one rupee notes. Signature on currency notes is of the incumbent RBI Governor. The One Rupee note is issued by the Ministry of Finance and it bears the signatures of the Finance Secretary. 27. Proportional Reserve System in India: Evolution and Transition to Minimum Reserve System Originally, the assets of the Issue department were to consist of not less than 2/5th of the Gold or sterling securities, provided Gold was not less than Rs. 40 Crores in value. Remaining 3/5th of the assets might be rupee coins. This was called the “Proportional Reserve System”. In 1956, this system was changed to Minimum reserve System Now, RBI is required to maintain a Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves of 200 Crore, of which at least Rs. 115 Crore should be in Gold. Against minimum reserve, the RBI is empowered to issue currency to any extent. This has been followed since 1956 and is known as the Minimum Reserve System (MRS). 28. Currency Chests: Role and Establishment in India Currency chests are storehouses where banknotes and rupee coins are stocked on behalf of the Reserve Bank. The currency chests have been established with the State Bank of India, six associate banks, nationalized banks, private sector banks, a foreign bank, a state cooperative bank and a regional rural bank. Deposits into the currency chest are treated as reserves with the Reserve Bank and are included in the Cash Reserve Ratio. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 29.

Legal Tender Money: Recognized Currency for Transactions and Debts The ‘Legal tender’ is the money that is recognised by the law of the land, as valid for payment of transactions and debts. Denomination of a country’s currency by law, must be accepted as a medium of exchange and payment for a money debt. While usually all denominations of the circulating paper money are legal tenders, the denomination and amount in coins acceptable as legal tender varies from country to country. This is also called lawful money. The RBI Act of 1934, which gives the Central Bank the sole right to issue bank notes, states that “ Every bank note shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment for the amount expressed therein ”. The recognition or cancellation of the legal tender status is important because paper money derives all its value from the Government’s recognition of it. The legal tender money is of two types: Limited Legal Tender Money Unlimited Legal Tender Money Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Q. Which one of the following statements correctly describes the meaning of legal tender money? The money which is tendered in courts of law to defray the fee of legal cases. The money which a creditor is under compulsion to accept in settlement of his claims. The bank money in the forms of cheque, drafts, bills of exchange, etc. The metallic money in circulation in a country. Limited Legal Tender Money Unlimited Legal Tender Money This is a form of money, which can be paid in discharge of a debt up to a certain limit, and beyond this limit, a person may refuse to accept the payment and no legal action can be taken against. Coins are limited legal tender in India. Coins of any denomination not lower than one rupee are legal tender for payments up to 1,000 rupees . Fifty paise coins are legal tender for payments up to ten rupees . In this form of money, this can be paid in discharge of a debt of any amount. A person who refuses to accept this money a legal action can be taken against. Paper notes/currency are unlimited legal tender in India. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 2. Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT): Decentralized and Immutable Record-Keeping Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing. Blockchain Technology was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 for use in the crypto-currency bitcoin, as its public transaction ledger. Satoshi Nakamoto’s aim in creating the decentralized Bitcoin ledger—the blockchain—was to allow users to control their own money so that no third party, not even the government, would be able to access or monitor it. Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners. Blocks Miners Nodes Blocks: Blocks are files where data pertaining to the bitcoin network are permanently recorded. A block is like a page of a ledger or record book. Nodes: can be any kind of electronic device that maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network functioning. Miners: create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining. 3. Cryptocurrencies: Decentralized Digital Currencies Built on Blockchain A Cryptocurrency is an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographic functions to conduct financial transactions. It leverages blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability (ability of a blockchain ledger to remain unchanged, unaltered and indelible) The most important feature of a cryptocurrency is that it is not controlled by any central authority. The decentralized nature of the blockchain makes cryptocurrencies theoretically immune to the old ways of government control and interference. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 3.1 Evolution of Cryptocurrency: Birth of Bitcoin and Economic Context The 2008-2009 subprime mortgage crisis and recession led to Quantitative Easing in the U.S., increasing the dollar supply and reducing its purchasing power. Banks charge fees for online transfers, credit card transactions, and ATM withdrawals. Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 by an anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular since Bitcoin’s creation. Since January 2020 and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the crypto market has grown by over 500%. 4. Bitcoin: The Pioneer Cryptocurrency It is an electronic or digital currency that works on a peer-to-peer basis. It is decentralized and has no central authority controlling it. Bitcoins can be sent digitally to anyone who has a bitcoin address anywhere in the globe. One person could have multiple addresses for different purposes – personal, business and the like. Satoshi Nakamoto proposed bitcoin, which was an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof. A bitcoin is not printed currency but is a non- reputable (assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something) record of every transaction that it has been through. All this is part of a huge ledger called the blockchain . Since no authority controls the generation of the coins or tracks them, the system itself is designed in such a way that the network maintains a foolproof system of the record of every transaction as well as tracking issuance of the currency sent without either side knowing the identity of the other Bitcoins are ‘mined’ using computing power in a distributed network. It’s the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Q. With reference to ‘Bitcoins’ sometimes seen in the news, which of the following statements is/are correct? (CSE-2019) Bitcoins are tracked by the Central Banks of the countries. Anyone with a Bitcoin address can send and receive Bitcoins from anyone else with a Bitcoin address. Online payments can be sent without either side knowing the identity of the other. Select the correct answer using the code given below. 1 and 2 only 3 only 2 and 3 only 1, 2 and 3 Bitcoins Decentralized Transparent Traded digitally Non-repudiable Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 5. Libra: Facebook’s Global Cryptocurrency Initiative There’s a new cryptocurrency called Libra to be rolled out by Facebook by 2020. It wants to be a ‘ global currency ’, one that can be used to transfer money anywhere in the world without any transaction fees. It is the asset-backed cryptocurrency meant to revolutionize international money. Asset-backed cryptocurrencies are crypto coins that have a link to an object with economic value. 6. CRYPTO-CURRENCIES VS DIGITAL CURRENCIES CRYPTO-CURRENCIES DIGITAL CURRENCIES Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and the regulations inside the network are governed by the majority of the community. Digital currencies are centralized, meaning that transaction within the network is regulated in a centralized location, like a bank. Cryptocurrencies are transparent. Anyone and everyone is able to see any and all transactions made and received by any user, as all revenue streams are placed in a public chain – the blockchain. Digital currencies are not transparent. With digital currencies, you cannot choose the address of the wallet and see all money transfers since the beginning of time. This information is kept strictly confidential and private. Cryptocurrencies are regulated by their respective communities. Most countries have some legal framework surrounding digital currencies. Digital currencies have a central authority that can deal with any problems or issues. This central body can, for example, freeze or cancel transactions on the request of the participant or the authorities. An Encrypt Form Of Digital Currency. A Unified Electronic Cash-form.

They pose several risks, including anti-money laundering and terrorism financing concerns for the state and liquidity, credit, and operational risks for users. From the perspective of consumers, issues linked to crypto-currencies are heightened by the striking paucity of information on their design, use and operation and indications of market manipulation. It is possible that the business models of commercial banks may be seriously disrupted. 8. RBI’ STAND ON DECENTRALISED DIGITAL CURRENCY (VIRTUAL) CURRENCY In 2018, the RBI banned banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies. In May 2020, the Supreme Court ruled this ban unconstitutional. The government proposed the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021. This bill aims to create a sovereign digital currency and ban private cryptocurrencies. The recommendation of an inter-ministerial committee that India should ban all private cryptocurrencies, that is, Bitcoin and others like it, hardly comes as a surprise. The Finance Minister, in his Budget speech in 2018, said the government doesn’t consider them legal tender. The RBI has repeatedly warned the public of the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Exceptions exist to promote the technology behind cryptocurrencies. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Taxation and Regulation India imposes a 30% tax on crypto investors and a 1% TDS on crypto intra-traders. Cryptocurrencies in India are not only not regulated but also not legalized. The consultation paper on cryptocurrencies is nearly ready, with input from domestic and international stakeholders, including the World Bank and IMF. Legal Status and Global Perspective Cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government or private organization. Their legal status affects their use in transactions and trading. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommends AML compliance for crypto wire transfers under the Travel Rule. El Salvador accepts Bitcoin as legal tender (as of December 2021). Japan’s Payment Services Act recognizes Bitcoin as legal property. 10. CONCERNS WITH CRYPTO -CURRENCIES A May 2019 article by Bloomberg, citing data from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, said “speculation remains Bitcoin’s primary use case”. Its use in illegal online marketplaces that deal with drugs and child pornography is well-documented. There have been cases of consumers being defrauded, including in India. Given all this, it is understandable that the committee, under the chairmanship of Subhash Chandra Garg, the former Economic Affairs Secretary, has come across as being cautious of private cryptocurrencies even while advocating a central bank-issued cryptocurrency. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 11. CRYPTO-CURRENCY PANEL FOR BAN ON PRIVATE DIGITAL CURRENCIES The committee headed by finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg set up to look into the legality of cryptocurrencies and blockchain has submitted its report to the Finance Ministry and recommended that private cryptocurrencies be banned completely in India. The committee notes with serious concern mushrooming of cryptocurrencies almost invariably issued abroad and numerous people in India investing in these. The Committee, however, leaves the door open for the central bank issued cryptocurrencies, adding that it endorsed the RBI’s stance of banning any sort of interface of cryptocurrencies with the banking system in India. The Committee recommends that all private cryptocurrencies, except any cryptocurrency issued by the state, be banned in India. It endorses the stand taken by the RBI to eliminate the interface of institutions regulated by the RBI from cryptocurrencies. However, the report goes on to say that it would be advisable to “have an open mind” regarding the introduction of an official, government-backed cryptocurrency in India. But it also added that it is currently unclear what the advantages of such a currency in India would be. 12. BANNING OF CRYPTOCURRENCY & REGULATION OF OFFICIAL DIGITAL CURRENCY BILL, 2019 The Subhash Chandra Garg committee has drafted a law which mandates a fine and imprisonment of up to 10 years for offences. The draft law says that anybody who mines, generates, holds, sells, deals in, transfers, disposes of or issues cryptocurrencies will face a fine and/or jail time of between 1 and 10 years. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 12.1 Reasons for the Ban on Cryptocurrencies: All the cryptocurrencies have been created by non-sovereigns. They do not have any intrinsic value of their own and lack any of the attributes of a currency. That is, they neither act as a store of value nor are they a medium of exchange in themselves. These cryptocurrencies cannot serve the purpose of a currency. The private cryptocurrencies are inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency, hence private cryptocurrencies cannot replace fiat currencies. 13. Advantages of DLT and Blockchain Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have no central data store or administration functionality. While the committee has taken a strong stance against cryptocurrencies, it has highlighted the benefits of the DLT technology and blockchain. The Committee recommends that blockchain based systems may be considered by MEITY for building a low-cost KYC system that reduces the need for duplication of KYC requirements for individuals. DLT-based systems can be used by banks and other financial firms for loan tracking, collateral management, fraud detection, claims management in insurance Similarly, DLT can be beneficial for removing errors and frauds in land markets if the technology is implemented for maintaining land records. The Committee therefore recommends that various state governments may examine the feasibility of using DLT for land-records management. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 14. SUPREME COURT ON CRYPTOCURRENCY (2020) Recently, the Supreme Court struck down a circular of RBI, which bans financial institutions from enabling deals in digital or cryptocurrencies. The ban that came into force in April 2018, had crippled the Indian cryptocurrency industry. This ban was challenged by the Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMA)in the Supreme Court, the IAMA pleaded that dealing and trading in cryptocurrency was a legitimate business activity and that the RBI did not have jurisdiction over it as these assets could be classified as commodities rather than currency. 14.1 Judgment on Ban on Virtual Currencies Economic Dimension: While the RBI had the power to take note of and deal with virtual currencies, the prohibition was excessive since it cut off the lifeline of otherwise legitimate trade. Administrative Aspect: An outright ban on virtual currencies would be a disproportionate measure by the government since ma­ny less intrusive measures are available. Constitutional Aspect: Theban was unconstitutional. It is in violation of the freedom to carry on trade guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution. 14.2 Way Forward for Virtual Currencies in India Rather than impose bans, it would be more pragmatic to institute awareness campaigns to alert investors to specific risks, and to monitor trades for fraud and scams. There is a need for RBI to formulate a detailed regulatory framework to license virtual currency intermediaries like exchanges. These local cryptocurrency exchanges could be asked to adhere to the KYC norms followed by stock exchanges. A vibrant cryptocurrency segment could add value to India’s financial sector. Thus, in the face of growing technological innovation in the financial sector, it is critical to strengthen the supporting regulatory frameworks of India that operate regardless of the nature of an instrument.

It was started in 2017 and measures the capacity and readiness of 63economies to adopt and explore digital technologies as a key driver for economic transformation in business, government and wider society. To evaluate an economy, WDCR examines 3 factors: Knowledge: capacity to understand and learn the new technologies; Technology: competence to develop new digital innovations; and future Readiness: preparedness for coming developments 17. Digital Payment Platforms: UPI and UPI 2.0, BHIM and BHIM 2.0, Bharat QR, AEPS, EMV Cards 17.1 UPI and UPI 2.0 UPI is a payment system that allows money transfer between any two bank accounts by using a smartphone. It was launched in April 2016 UPI allows a customer to pay directly from a bank account to different merchants, both online and offline , without the hassle of typing credit card details, IFSC code, or net banking/wallet passwords. It also caters to the “ Peer to Peer ”(P2P) collect request which can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience. NPCI has upgraded the UPI as UPI 2.0 with enhanced features such as- Linking of overdraft account: Apart from the savings and current accounts, the UPI users can now link their overdraft account to it. One-time Mandate (account blocking): It allows customers or merchants to pre-authorize a transaction and pay at a later date. Security Layer in QR: The app allows the users to scan the QR code and check the authenticity of the merchants through notification to the user to ascertain the information. Increased Transaction Limit: From 1 lakh/day to 2 lakh/day. Signed Intent and QR (Quick Response code): This feature helps customers to check the authenticity of merchants while scanning QR. It notifies the user with information to ascertain whether the merchant is a verified UPI merchant or not. This provides an additional security. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Q. Which of the following is a most likely consequence of implementing the ‘Unified Payments Interface (UPI)’? [CSE-2017] Mobile wallets will not be necess a ry for online payments. Digital currency will totally replace the physical currency in about two decades. FDI inflows will drastically increase. Direct transfer of subsidies to poor people will become very effective. 17.2 BHIM AND BHIM 2.0 Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) is a mobile payments application based on NPCI’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI). BHIM is developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) The BHIM app was launched in December 2016 by NPCI. A new and modified version of Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), BHIM 2.0 has been launched under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Under BHIM 2.0, the existing cap of 20,000 has been increased to Rs. 1,00,000, from verified merchants. BHIM provides an easy and secure mode of money transfer for the users on a mobile platform. It provides the facility to easily send or receive money from other customers using the UPI.

Bharat QR is P2M (Person to Merchant) Mobile payment solution. This solution is mutually derived among NPCI, Visa and Mastercard payment networks. Once the BQR codes are deployed on Merchant locations, user can pay the utility bills using BQR enabled mobile banking apps without sharing any user credentials to the merchant. It is a quick method of payment. Bharat QR transactions are different from POS In POS transaction, POS terminal is required whereas in Bharat QR transaction, QR Code is required. 17.4 AEPS Aadhar Enabled Payments System is bank-led model which allows online interoperable financial inclusion transactions at Point of Sale through the business correspondent of any bank using Aadhaar authentication. 17.5 EMV CARDS (EUROPAY-MASTERCARD-VISA) Debit card security standard that includes a small micro-chip in the debit card. The microprocessor chip embedded in the card prevents card skimming or cloning that is possible in magnetic stripe cards Enroll now for UPSC Online Course ADVANTAGE OVER MAGNETIC STRIPE CARDS The magnetic stripe credit and debit cards store the data on the magnetic stripe found on the reverse side of the card. Fraudsters place a skimmer device inside the card swipe slot in ATMs or PoS terminals to read the customer data stored in the magnetic stripe. EMV chip cards prevent such skimming because they do not reveal the user data to the terminal at the time of swiping the card. MOBILE MONEY IDENTIFIER (MMID) MMID is a 7-digit number issued by banks. Every bank account has only one MMID. Different MMID can be linked to same Mobile Number. MMID is one of the input that, when clubbed with mobile number, facilitates fund transfer. combination of Mobile number . & MMID is uniquely linked with an Account number and helps in identifying the beneficiary details. 18. MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE (MDR) MDR is the cost paid by a merchant to a bank for accepting payment by digital means from their customers, which is usually recovered from the customer. MDR also called as the Transaction Discount Rate (TDR) MDR is user-fee charged by the banks to merchants for facilitating card-based or digital transactions. It is charged as a percentage of the transaction amount. Recently the government has done away with MDR altogether for large-retails, clearing the way for adoption of low-cost digital payments like BHIM UPI, UPI-QR Code, Aadhaar Pay etc. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Q. Which one of the following best describes the term “Merchant Discount Rate” sometimes seen in news? (CSE-2019) The incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting payments through debit cards pertaining to that bank. The amount paid back by banks to their customers when they use debit cards for financial transactions for purchasing goods or services. The charge to a merchant by a bank for accepting payments from his customers through the bank’s debit cards. The incentive is given by the Government to merchants for promoting digital payments by their customers through Point of Sale (PoS) machines and debit cards. 19. PAYMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS SYSTEM System that facilitates transfer of money from the payer to the beneficiary. The payment and settlement systems act, 2007 provides for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India and designates the Reserve Bank of India as the authority for that purpose and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. It includes both paper-based payments such as checks and drafts as well as electronic payments such as Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), immediate payment Service (IMPS), UPI, etc. 20. LABELS OF ATM IN INDIA The ATM entered India in late 1980s and have evolved into three of its types by now: Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching LABLES DETAILS Bank’s own ATMs These are owned and operated by the concerned bank and carry the bank’s ‘logo’. They are the costliest way to provide such service to bank’s customers. Brown Label ATMs (BLAs) These are owned by a third party (a non-banking firm). The concerned banks only handle part of the process that is ‘cash handling’ and ‘back-end server’ connectivity. These are ‘owned’ and ‘operated’ by a third party (a non-banking firm). White Label ATMs (WLAs) They do not bear the ‘logo’ of the banks they serve. They are interconnected with the entire ATM network in the country. The Tata Communications Payment Solutions became the first such firm to get permission from the RBI – Brand name was “Indicash”. The 3rd parties have a mandate to deploy – 67% ATMs – Rural location 33% ATMs – Urban location Example: Tata communications payment solutions is the first firm to get permission from RBI (‘Indicash’) 21. CARD TYPES BASED ON PAYMENT MODALITY Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 21.1 Credit Cards: Plastic Money It allows the holder to make purchases on credit (loan), even if he may / may not have sufficient balance in his bank account at the time of purchase. Customer does shopping using credit card; bank transfers the concerned amount to merchant from bank’s own funds and later bank recovers same amount from customer. Customers can pay the entire due amount at once or convert it into Equated Monthly Installments (EMI). Interest rate may be charged depending on billing cycle, grace period and other terms and conditions If Credit card is used for withdrawing money from an ATM, then it’s a type of ‘borrowing’, so, bank levies an interest rate. 21.2 Debit Cards: Plastic Money It allows the holder to make purchases upto the extent of the amount lying in his own bank balance. Customer does shopping using a debit card, and the bank transfers the concerned amount from the customer’s own bank account to the merchant. If he has insufficient balance, he may not be able to make a purchase. Although nowadays e-commerce sites allow debit-card based EMIs,. Debit cards can be used to withdraw money from an ATM from your existing bank balance. So, it’s not ‘borrowing’. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 21.3 HYBRID CARD / DUO CARD Single card containing two chips for credit card debit card So, you don’t have to carry two separate cards. E.g. Indus bank Hybrid card. 21.4 PRE -PAID CARD It’s a subtype of debit card. While debit card is linked to a given bank account, a person can buy pre-paid card even without having account in the given bank Example: IRCTC’s UBI prepaid card, which can be used for buying rail tickets, meals etc. 22. DIGITAL PAYMENT REGULATORY BODIES 22.1 Establishment of Digital Transactions Ombudsman (DTO) RBI designates senior RBI officials at 21 places across India as Digital Transactions Ombudsman (DTO) They will hear customer complaints upto ₹ 20 lakh against prepaid payment instruments, Mobile wallets, Apps, NEFT/RTGS and other digital transactions. They can order the company / bank to revert /settle the transaction and pay upto additional ₹ 1 lakh for mental agony of the customer. Higher Appeal to Dy.Gov of RBI. If the amount involved is more than ₹ 20 lakh, then matter is outside his jurisdiction. Victim has to approach ordinary courts/consumer courts, depending on the case matter. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching In line with the recommendations of the report of the “committee on deepening of digital payments” chaired by Nandan Nilekani, RBI announced creation of a Payments Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF). The 500 crores PIDF seeks to encourage acquirers to deploy Points of Sale (PoS) infrastructure for both physical and digital modes. 22.2 Establishment of Payment Regulatory Board (PRB) 1998: Narasimhan-II Committee on Banking Reforms suggested regulatory framework for e-banking, card payment etc. 2007: Payment & Settlement Systems Act established Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS) in RBI. All payment system providers have to register with RBI’s BPSS- whether bank, non-bank, wallet/Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) etc. 2016: Ratan Watal Committee on digital payment suggested replacing this BPSS with a Payments Regulatory Board (PRB) in RBI, to look after Interoperability, Consumer protection, Innovation, R&D in digital payments. 2018: Draft Payment and Settlement System Bill to implement it. But, RBI vs Government difference of opinion about who should be chairman, how many members from Government side etc. 23. RECOMMENDATIONS OF NANDAN NILEKANI PANEL ON REFORMING RBI AND NPCI RBI should prepare area-wise ‘Digital Financial Inclusion Index’ to monitor progress & take remedial steps. Ensure no user is more than 5 kms away from a banking access point. Local vendor should be made Banking Correspondent(BC). Setup an Acceptance Development Fund (ADF) to develop digital payment infrastructure in poorly served areas (e.g. subsidy on PoS devices). RBI and Banks should co-contribute fiscal amount in this fund. Reduce the MDR / card payment fees. Allow customer to do “n” number of digital payment transactions per month with no charges. RBI should make NEFT available 24/7 and review charges on its usage. (June 2019: RBI removed charges on both NEFT and RTGS and asked the banks to pass on the benefits to customers.) NPCI should offer RuPay and BHIM UPI in other countries to facilitate remittance to India. Encourage local language apps/ software for digital payments. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 24. DEMONETISATION – CRITICAL ANALYSIS Demonetization is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. Demonetization has been used as a tool to stabilize a currency and fight inflation, to facilitate trade and access to markets, and to push informal economic activity into more transparency and away from black and grey markets. 24.1 EARLIER DEMONETIZATIONS IN INDIA The first demonetisation was implemented in 1946 (RBI demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 notes) The Morarji Desai government demonetised these notes in 1978 . 24.2 POSITIVE IMPACTS OF DEMONETISATION Increase in tax collection and considerable increase in the number of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) filed. ITR registered an increase of 24.7%. Tackling Black Money: The government has identified more than 37000 shell companies which were engaged in hiding black money and hawala Impacts on terrorism, Naxalism, and trafficking – Due to demonetisation, terrorist and Naxalite financing has stopped almost entirely . The note ban had led to a huge fall in sex trafficking. Since demonetisation, no high-quality fake currency notes have been found/seized by intelligence operations. Increase in Digital Transactions: digital transactions have increased by around 50-55% points since demonetisation. RBI has to print fewer notes which save printing costs of the government. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Cash – to – GDP Ratio: It gives the ratio of cash currency available in the market to the total monetary value of GDP. Currency-to-GDP ratio as of March 2019 was 11.23% which is the highest in three years. Tax-to-GDP Ratio: It represents the size of a country’s tax kitty relative to its GDP. It is a representation of the size of the government’s tax revenue expressed as a percentage of the GDP. Higher the tax to GDP ratio the better financial position the country will be in. 24.3 Negative Impacts of Demonetisation in India Poor Planning: At the time of demonetisation, the high-value notes constitute 87.5% of the currency value. Impacts on Jobs: As people ran out of money, they could not be able to pay which results in economic slowed down & supply-chain of informal sector gets affected. Impacts on Savings: Households are now holding far more of their savings in cash than in the year prior to demonetisation. Impacts on Government Expenditure: by RBI cost the government around Rs 8000 crore during the period between July 2016-June 2017. Impacts on GDP: Country’s growth rate, which was 7.5% in September 2016 declined to 5.7% in June 2017 a reduction of 1.5%. It is still apparent that corruption has not yet been suppressed since demonetisation. The cash-GDP ratio has reached levels similar to the period before demonetisation. Stress in agriculture has begun to appear because of demonetization pertaining to cash as the dominant mode of transaction in the agriculture sector. Banks are not in a position to considerably increase lending; their net interest income has decreased. Worsening their capital situation and their NPA situation got worse. 25. Promoting a Less Cash Economy in India Ratan Watal Committee to the Finance Ministry for medium-term recommendations to strengthen the digital payment ecosystem. Chandrababu Naidu chief ministers’ Committee to PM to promote digital payment. HRD ministry’s Vittiya Saksharta Abhiyan wherein college students explain to people about digital transactions. NITI and NPCI jointly launched lottery and cash back schemes for customers (Lucky Grahak) and merchants (Digi Dhan Vyapar). The government itself launched further referral bonus, cashback schemes for using UPI-BHIM. Budget-2017: Imposed ceilings on cash transactions, provided tax incentives to companies for using digital transactions, reduced custom duties on ATM related devices. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Digidhan Mission (2017): Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), to create awareness about digital payments. MeitY also launched a DIGIDHAN DASHBOARD web portal to monitor the digital transactions in India. Budget-2018: promised to explore blockchain technology for promoting the digital economy. Budget-2019: Imposed Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) on withdrawal of ₹1 cr or more from a single user account. Digital Payment Abhiyan (2019- Sept): launched by MEITY along with Google India and Data Security Council of India (DSCI, a not-for-profit organization by NASSCOM). 26. BLACK MONEY- CRITICAL ANALYSIS An income which is not declared by a person or a group of persons in a nation is termed as black money. It is also termed as ‘illegitimate’ as it goes unrecognized for the tax declaration. 26.1 Definition and Significance of Black Money There is no universal definition for black money in economics. In layman’s language, it is money that has been acquired through illegitimate means or money which is unaccounted for, that is, for which tax is not paid to the government. Cash transactions without proper accounting are classified as black money. Black money is hidden from government authorities and is not reflected in the GDP of India, national income, etc. White money is money that is earned through legitimate means and is accounted for, for which income or other tax is paid. In an ideal economy, all money that is transacted should be accounted for. This would help the government collect taxes. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course 26.2 GENERATION OF BLACK MONEY Illegitimate activities The illegal activities that can lead to black money generation are: Crime Corruption Non-compliance with tax requirements Complex procedural regulations Money laundering Smuggling Tax evasion This is where an entity wilfully does not pay taxes that are due to the government. Tax avoidance This is where an entity takes advantage of the existing loopholes in the system and avoids paying taxes. This is not illegal though. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes 26.3 Sources of Black Money in India: A Comprehensive Overview Sellers or traders who do not give bills or receipts create black money. Many people invest in bullion or jewellery to hide their actual income from the authorities. In the real estate sector , many people undervalue their real assets to refrain from paying the rightful tax. Some SHGs and trusts do not provide proper sources for their funds and donations received. Tax Havens: Tax havens are generally small countries where foreigners don’t have to pay taxes. These countries generally have very liberal regulatory frameworks, which big corporations take advantage of. Setting up shell companies and redirecting all their profits to this entity, by which they can reduce their tax liabilities by a huge margin. Investments through innovative derivative instruments like participatory notes (P-Notes) also are a means to hide black money. 26.4 Impacts of Black Money on the Economy and Society It affects the financial system of the country. The central bank is not able to control money supply in the economy, causing higher inflation. This will lead to a fall in the value of the currency. Black money affects the credibility of a country negatively. It is most often used for illegal activities such as drugs and narcotics dealing, terrorism, etc. The government suffers a big loss in the form of taxes because of black money. Black money creates a parallel economy in the country, which is completely underground. Black money can also cause real estate prices to go up, which may lead to an asset bubble. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 26.5 Measures Implemented to Combat Black Money Tax reforms have been initiated with a view to resisting black money. The tax base has been increased and rates have been slashed. Reforms are being made to incorporate tax deduction at the source itself. Through the Black Money Bill 2015, the government has allowed the reporting of black money generated through tax evasion in a given time frame. Demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 was carried out in 2016 with the primary view of making black money useless. The government is encouraging cashless and digital transactions with a view to making things more transparent. Electoral reforms are also intended to curb black money, as much of the black money generated in India is used in elections. 26.6 LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO DEAL WITH BLACK MONEY Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 Benami Transactions Prohibition Act, 1988 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013 27. MONEY LAUNDERING Money laundering is the process by which black money is converted into white money. People who possess black money cannot spend it publicly. They should either hide it or spend it on the underground economy. Through money laundering, people separate the money earned (illegally) from its source, mix it with white money, and then funnel it back into the source. Another associated term is round-tripping . In this, people send money to a tax haven like Mauritius or Cayman Islands (to avoid paying tax) and then invest that money into India, thus becoming a foreign investment.

    "content": "FINANCIAL INCLUSION Introduction of Financial Inclusion Financial inclusion is a critical global initiative aimed at ensuring that individuals and businesses, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have access to essential financial services and products. These services encompass basic banking, savings, credit, insurance, and digital payment systems. By promoting financial inclusion, societies strive to empower marginalized populations, reduce poverty, and foster economic growth, ultimately working toward a more equitable and prosperous future. This brief introduction sets the stage for exploring the multifaceted dimensions of financial inclusion and its far-reaching impact on individuals and economies worldwide. Understanding How Everyone Can Benefit from Banking and Financial Inclusion According to the World Bank, Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. Financial inclusion ensures financial literacy and Financial democracy for the people. This ensures social, economic and transaction security, improves social harmony, women empowerment, helps reaping the benefit of “Less Cash Economy” Financial inclusion or taking banking services to the common man was the main driver of bank nationalization in 1969 and 1980 powered by three priority areas – Access to banking Access to affordable credit Access to free face-to-face money advice. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Financial Inclusion for Everyone: Making Banking Easy and Fair for All Bank Accounts: Ensuring universal access to bank accounts, which are a gateway to all financial services. Digital Payment Services: Providing access to digital payment services and increasing its penetration. Insurance: Ensuring universal coverage of insurance for life, accidents, etc. Asset Diversification: Allowing diversification of the asset portfolio of households through increased participation in capital markets. Social Security: a system of payments / assistance by the government to citizens who are ill, handicapped, poor, aged or unemployed. Better access to credit at a reasonable cost for those presently excluded Social Justice: distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society- through reservation in jobs, admissions and election and through legal safeguards for protection of civil rights, prevention of atrocity and personnel laws. Article 41 (DPSP)– State to provide public assistance to its citizens in case of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement; Article 42 (DPSP)– The State shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief for Financial inclusion. Why We All Need Financial Inclusion: Closing Gaps for a Better Future Financial inclusion is a key enabler to reduce extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity, An ambitious global goal (World Bank ) to reach Universal Financial Access (UFA) by 2020. Financial inclusion has been identified as an enabler for 7 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Development: financial inclusion would result in higher savings, decrease in income inequality and poverty, increase in employment opportunities. Growth: greater access to formal credit would promote entrepreneurship in country Service Delivery: reach targeted beneficiary Financial inclusion has a multiplier effect in boosting overall economic output, reducing poverty and income inequality, and in promoting gender equality and women empowerment. Women Empowerment: Financial inclusion empowers women by involving them in household finances, promoting self-reliance and financial independence, and boosting financial literacy. It provides access to savings and credit for business and training, and encourages mobile phone ownership for financial transactions. Additionally, banks offer women-specific benefits like lower interest rates and better savings incentives. Examples of schemes launched for financial inclusion include PMJDY, Mudra loans, Atal Pension Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, and Stand-up India. Enroll now for Online Course Understanding Opportunities: The Advantages of Financial Inclusion for All Reduce the gap between rich and poor people Boosts the financial condition and standards of life of the poor and disadvantaged population. Help in implementing social security schemes Lowers the transaction cost for daily economic activity. Enables creation of economic buffers for exigencies Better monitoring and regulation of financial transaction using digital technology It helps the government plug leakage in public subsidies and welfare programmes as it can directly transfer the subsidy amount into the account of the beneficiary. Poor and downtrodden are encouraged to invest in various financial products and can borrow from formal financial channels. It increases the amount of available savings and the rate of capital formation, thereby allowing tapping of new business opportunities. Understanding the Costs of Financial Exclusion The more a country is financialized, the more people who have no access to financial products face difficulties and will suffer from important financial, economic and social consequences. Accepting a job can be more difficult, if there is widespread financial exclusion, as most employers insist on paying wages electronically into an account. Getting access to other financial products (insurance, credit) may depend on being able to pay by direct debit and not having a bank account also reduces credit scores. In the face of widespread financial exclusion, for the affected people, the only option in times of need is illegal lenders. Such lenders apply default charges that can be extortionate and arbitrary—a vicious cycle of perpetual indebtedness sets in. People who save informally (that is, not in a bank account) do not benefit from the interest rates and tax advantages that people with savings accounts enjoy. Savings kept in cash at home are vulnerable to theft. If the SMEs sector is affected by financial exclusion, then their potential contribution to overall economic growth is severely hampered. Further, given the fact that about two-third of the units in this sector are owned by the disadvantaged section, such an exclusion results in a form of social injustice. Financial inclusion broadens the resource base of the financial system by developing a culture of savings among large segments of the rural population and plays its own role in the process of economic development. Financial inclusion also mitigates the exploitation of vulnerable sections by usurious money lenders by facilitating easy access to formal credit.

Scheme is illegal and vaguely designed. Every month each subscriber deposits equal amount, as stipulated in the scheme document Every month Foreman draws ‘chit’. whichever subscribers’ name comes he may get loan / prize.(in next month, previous winners’ names may not be added to the lottery pool). This way, everyone has an equal chance of winning. There are no official documents or account books. Scamster will accept whatever small / large amount is offered by the poor person who falls prey. Investor doesn’t know with surety how much is contributed by other investors. Even if you won in Feb-2020, still you’ll have to compulsorily pay monthly deposits until Dec-2020 when the scheme is officially over. Not compulsory to pay the monthly deposits after you’ve won the prize. (Therefore the scheme will collapse eventually, when new subscribers stop coming). This is legal, under Chit Funds Act This is illegal under Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act, 1978 Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Why Chit Funds? Understanding the Attraction and Potential for Financial Inclusion Low rates of interest on small savings provided by commercial banks are usually not coherent with the market rate. Obtaining formal loans still remains a huge task for a common man as banks, financial institutions are plagued by stringent procedures. Less regulated regime at fairly competitive interest rates prevailing in the market makes these schemes easily accessible. Chit funds come handy to meet exigencies like death or ill-health as well as joyous occasions like marriages. These types of schemes promote a savings culture as each member is supposed to contribute a fixed amount every month towards the fund. Making Chit Funds Fair: Understanding the Changes in the Chit Funds (Amendment) Act, 2019 for Financial Inclusion The 2019 act aims to amend 1982’s Chit Funds Act. Amendment act will regulate the ‘Chit Funds’, ‘Kuri’, ‘fraternity fund’, ‘rotating savings and credit institution’. Chit must be drawn in the presence of at least two subscribers.

Moreover, they also engaged in Multi-level marketing (MLM)/Pyramid /Ponzi Selling To avoid such scams in future, the Union Govt proposed “Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill 2018” and later ordinance in 2019. Exploring Financial Inclusion: The Imperative for Stricter Regulations of Chit Funds Fraudulent Companies: There have been rising instances of people in various parts of the country being defrauded by illicit deposit taking schemes such as Saradha Chit Fund Scam, Rose Valley Scam etc. Financial Illiteracy: Lack of financial literacy results in people getting duped as they are promised huge return on their investment which has no substantial basis to fulfill. Non-Transparency: Chit funds, especially those catering to a large number of members, are opaque both in their operations and eliciting of bids. Administrative Loopholes: Companies running such schemes exploit existing regulatory gaps and lack of strict administrative measures to dupe poor and gullible people of their hard-earned savings. Lack of Accountability: There is no deposit insurance for investors.

High volume of frauds due to lack of financial literacy Money lenders continue to account for nearly 30 percent of total banking business Most commercial banks operate in commercial and urban areas.

Financial inclusion is necessary before comprehensive success of mobile wallets. Financial services must be made accessible for people with disabilities at par with non-disabled persons. NABARD has an extensive presence across the country; it should be made the nodal and accountable agency for financial inclusion. Requires grass root level research as to why people prefer to go to money lenders, despite a network of banks, cooperatives, MFIs and SHGs. As India uses Aadhar to advance the goal of financial inclusion the government must examine and put into place a robust regime for data protection.

    "chapter_name": "BALANCE OF PAYMENT",
    "content": "Balance of Payment: Formula, Types, Key Features & Global Economics Introduction of Balance of Payment The Balance of Payment (BoP) serves as a comprehensive record detailing a country’s financial transactions with the rest of the world over a specified time frame. Also referred to as the balance of international payments and often abbreviated as BOP, it consolidates all financial activities involving individuals, entities, and government bodies. These transactions can fall into two categories: factored payments and transfer payments. The BoP statement meticulously documents each financial exchange occurring between entities during a designated period, offering insights into the inflow and outflow of funds and providing a valuable assessment of a nation’s economic standing. Balance of Payment An Explanation to Balance of Payment Formula The Balance of Payment (BoP) is the sum of the Current Account, Capital Account, Financial Account, and Errors and Omissions. Also Read | Financial Market Key Features of the Balance of Payment (BOP) Encompassing Financial Transactions: The BOP statement encompasses all international transactions, including those of individuals, corporations, and government entities. Ideal Balance: In an ideal scenario, where all fund flows are accurately accounted for, the BoP should consistently sum up to zero, signifying equilibrium between inflows and outflows. Real-world Variation: While balance may not be achieved in day-to-day operations, a BOP surplus denotes a country’s positive financial position in international transactions, while a deficit indicates the opposite. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Balance of Payment Surplus: Exploring its Meaning, Causes, and Economic Implications A BOP surplus materializes when a country’s exports to other nations surpass its imports. This surplus can provide capital for domestic production and allow the country to invest funds abroad. Purposes of BoP Calculation The BoP plays several vital roles: Economic Indicator: It reveals a nation’s fiscal and economic status. Currency Value: Helps determine whether a country’s currency is appreciating or depreciating. Policy Decision: Assists governments in shaping financial and trade policies. Economic Analysis: Provides essential data for analyzing a country’s economic interactions with other nations. Understanding the Components of Balance of Payment (BOP): Current Account, Capital Account, Financial Account, and More The BOP statement consists of three main categories: the current account, the capital account, and the financial account. Each category includes various sub-divisions, accounting for different types of international financial transactions. Additionally, it incorporates Errors and Omissions and changes in Foreign Exchange Reserves. Current Account: Reflects a country’s export and import status, covering goods, services, and transfer payments. A surplus indicates more exports than imports, while a deficit signifies the opposite. Balance of Trade: Records transactions involving goods. Balance of Invisibles: Documents transactions involving services such as consulting services , shipping services , tourism , etc. Transfer Payments: Includes items like donations, grants, and remittances. Capital Account: Deals with the purchase and sale of assets, including financial and non-financial ones, such as land. Loans and Borrowings: Encompasses loans from both private and public sectors abroad. Investments: Includes Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), and other investments. Foreign Exchange Reserves: Held by the central bank to monitor exchange rates. Financial Account: Encompasses international fund flows related to investments in businesses, real estate, bonds, stocks , government assets , and individual and official foreign-owned assets. Errors and Omissions Represents imbalances resulting from inaccuracies in data and calculations. Changes in Foreign Exchange Reserves Tracks changes in foreign currency reserves held by the central bank. Balance of Payment vs. Balance of Trade – Components, Coverage, and Economic Significance Balance of Payment Balance of Trade: Focuses solely on the net gain or loss from importing and exporting goods. Balance of Payment: Encompasses all economic transactions with other nations, including goods, services, money transfers, and capital movements . Topic Balance of Payment (BoP) Balance of Trade (BoT) Components The current account, capital account, financial account, errors and omissions Trade in goods (merchandise trade) Coverage Trade in goods, services, income flows, and transfers (current and capital) Trade in physical goods (raw materials, manufactured goods, commodities) Definition A comprehensive record of all economic transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world over a specific period Difference between the value of a country’s exports and imports of goods (merchandise trade) over a specific period Focus A comprehensive view of a country’s economic transactions with the rest of the world Focuses solely on the trade of goods Inclusion of Services, Income Flows, and Transfers Yes No Understanding Disequilibrium in Balance of Payments: Causes, Types, and Economic Implications Disequilibrium within the BOP’s denotes an unbalance or incongruity between the inflows and outflows of economic transactions in a country’s balance of payments. This signifies that the nation’s international payments are not in equilibrium, indicating either a surplus or a deficit. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Disequilibrium within the balance of payments can manifest in two forms: Surplus in Balance of Payments: A surplus in the balance of payments emerges when the inflow of foreign currency , stemming from exports , foreign investments , or borrowing , exceeds the outflows, which include imports, capital outflows, or the repayment of foreign loans. A surplus suggests that the country holds a net creditor position concerning the rest of the world. Deficit in Balance of Payments: Deficit Conversely, a deficit in the BOP arises when the outflows of foreign currency surpass the inflows. This typically occurs when a nation imports more goods and services than it exports or when it experiences capital outflows or debt repayments that outweigh capital inflows. A deficit indicates that the country holds a net debtor position relative to the rest of the world. Importance of Balance of Payment: Insights into Economic Health, Policy Formulation, and International Financial Stability The balance of payments (BoP) holds significant importance for several reasons: Economic Indicator: The BoP serves as a crucial economic indicator reflecting a country’s economic relationships with the rest of the world. It provides valuable information on trade flows , financial transactions , and overall economic health . Policy Formulation: Policymakers utilize the BoP to formulate and evaluate economic policies. It offers insights into a country’s competitiveness , external trade performance , capital flows , and monetary stability , aiding in the design of appropriate policies to address imbalances and promote economic growth. Exchange Rate Management: The BoP is closely tied to exchange rates . Central banks monitor it to assess the supply and demand for foreign currency , determine the need for currency interventions, and manage exchange rate stability. External Debt Management: The BoP plays a pivotal role in managing external debt. It helps countries monitor their capacity to service foreign debt obligations and assess the sustainability of borrowing levels, promoting prudent debt management and reducing external financial vulnerability. Investment Decisions: Investors and financial institutions analyze the BoP to evaluate a country’s attractiveness for investment . A favorable BoP position, indicating stability and positive economic prospects , can attract foreign investment and contribute to economic development. Policy Coordination: The BoP facilitates international policy coordination by enabling policymakers to identify areas of cooperation, address global imbalances , and promote stability in the international financial system. Understanding Balance of Payment Crisis – Causes, Consequences, and Mitigation Strategies A balance of payment (BoP) crisis occurs when a country experiences severe imbalances in its external accounts , leading to difficulties in meeting its international payment obligations. This typically involves a rapid depletion of foreign exchange reserves , currency depreciation , challenges in accessing external financing, and potential disruptions in trade and capital flows. Several historical examples of BoP crises underscore the economic and financial consequences they entail. These crises highlight the significance of sound economic policies , prudent debt management , and macroeconomic stability in avoiding or mitigating BoP crises. Exploring India’s Balance of Payments: Current Trends, Key Indicators Narrowing Current Account Deficit (CAD): CAD reduced to $9.2 billion (1.1% of GDP) from $17.9 billion (2.1% of GDP) in the same quarter last year. However, higher than the preceding quarter’s $1.3 billion (0.2% of GDP). Factors Contributing to CAD Widening: Increased trade deficits, decreased net services surpluses, and a decline in private transfer receipts contributed to CAD expansion. Net services receipts dropped due to reduced exports of computer, travel, and business services. Financial Account Changes: Net foreign direct investment decreased to $5.1 billion from $13.4 billion last year. Net foreign portfolio investment saw significant inflows of $15.7 billion compared to $14.6 billion outflows last year. Net external commercial borrowings to India showed inflow of $5.6 billion against $2.9 billion outflow last year. Non-resident deposits recorded net inflows of $2.2 billion, a notable increase from $0.3 billion last year. External Debt and Overall Implications: India’s external debt reached $629.1 billion by June 2023 , marking a $4.7 billion increase from March 2023. Despite fluctuations, narrowing CAD and increased foreign investment inflows signal positive developments in India’s global economic interactions. UPSC Guide: Understanding Balance of Payments – What It Is, Why It Matters, and Its Significance in UPSC Exams The topic of the Balance of Payment holds considerable significance for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examination. It falls within the economy section of the UPSC syllabus and is essential for aspirants preparing for the UPSC examination.

Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Balance of Payment FAQs Q1: What is meant by balance of payment? Ans: The Balance of Payments (BOP), also referred to as the balance of international payments, represents a comprehensive record of all financial transactions occurring between entities within a specific country and the entirety of the global community during a designated time frame, which can span from a quarter to a year. Q2: What is the balance of payment with example? Ans: Country A imports goods valued at $10 million, representing an inflow to the country within the Current Account. In return for these goods, Country A made payments to Country B, resulting in a financial outflow from Country A under the Financial Account. Q3: What are the principles of BoP? Ans: The construction of a country’s balance of payments account adheres to the fundamental principle of double-entry bookkeeping. Under this system, every transaction is duly recorded on both the credit and debit sides of the balance sheet. Consequently, the sum of the total debits equals the sum of the total credits within the BOPs, ensuring perfect equilibrium. Conclusion In conclusion, a grasp of Balance of Payments is essential for UPSC aspirants, providing insights into economic relationships and trade dynamics. Its significance extends to policy formulation, exchange rate management, and international debt considerations, making it a crucial topic for exam preparation."

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an organization of 189 member countries, each of which has representation on the IMF’s executive board in proportion to its financial importance, so that the most powerful countries in the global economy have the most voting power. International Monetary Fund (IMF) helps in global currency exchange stability, helps against the balance of payment crisis. Acts as a reservoir of the currencies of all the member countries, from which a borrower nation can borrow the currency of other nations- using the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) mechanism. It thus strives to provide a systematic mechanism for foreign exchange transactions in order to foster investment and promote balanced global economic trade. IMF important decisions need to be passed with an 85% majority.

As part of this process, which takes place both at the global level and in individual countries, the IMF highlights possible risks to stability and advises on needed policy adjustments. Capacity Development: The World Bank plays a crucial role in providing technical assistance and training to central banks, finance ministries, tax authorities, and other economic institutions. This helps countries raise public revenues, modernize banking systems, develop strong legal frameworks, improve governance, and enhance the reporting of macroeconomic and financial data. It also helps countries to make progress towards the SDGs. IMF’s Financial Support: International Organizations and Lending Stand-by agreement Offers financing of a short – term balance of payments, usually between 12 to 18 months.

Poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) As the name implies, it aims to reduce poverty in the poorest of member countries while laying the foundations for economic development. Loans are administered with especially low interest rates. Emergency Fund The IMF also offers emergency funds to collapsed economies, as it did for Korea during the 1997 financial crisis in Asia. The funds were injected into Korea’s foreign reserves in order to boost the local currency, thereby helping the country avoid a damaging devaluation. Emergency funds can also be loaned to countries that have faced economic crisis as a result of a natural disaster.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) came into being in 1995. One of the youngest of the international organizations, the WTO is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) established in the wake of the Second World War. It has 164 Member States The General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was set up in 1948. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was the first worldwide multilateral free trade agreement. Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations decided to set up a permanent institution which can encourage international trade not only in goods, but also in services and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) → Marrakesh treaty (1994) → WTO started functioning from 1 st Jan 1995 at Geneva, Switzerland. India is a founding member. International Organizations: Simplifying Global Trade with GATT It all began with trade in goods. From 1947 to 1994, GATT was the forum for negotiating lower customs duty rates and other trade barriers; the text of the General Agreement spelt out important rules, particularly non-discrimination. Since 1995, the updated GATT has become the WTO’s umbrella agreement for trade in goods. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching World Bank and Global Services Trade: Understanding GATS The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) requires most-favored-nation Treatment, market access commitments and national treatment. GATS was agreed upon at the end of the Uruguay Round negotiations with the participation of all Member nations including developing countries. The GATS , overseen by international organizations like the World Bank, covers a wide range of service industries such as financial services, transport and shipping, communications, construction, and distribution. Understanding International Organization & Service Trade: Definitions and Supply Modes The definition of services trade under the GATS is four-pronged, depending on the territorial presence of the supplier and the consumer at the time of the transaction and overseen by international organizations. Mode 1 Cross border trade – from the territory of one Member into the territory of any other Member. Ex. A user in country A receives services from abroad through its telecommunications or postal infrastructure. Such supplies may include consultancy or market research reports, tele-medical advice, distance training, or architectural drawings. Mode 2 Consumption abroad – in the territory of one Member to the service consumer of any other Member. Ex. Nationals of A have moved abroad as tourists, students, or patients to consume the respective services. Mode 3 Commercial presence – by a service supplier of one Member, through commercial presence, in the territory of any other Member. Ex. The service is provided within A by a locally – established affiliate, subsidiary, or representative office of a foreign-owned and — controlled company (bank, hotel group, construction company, etc.). Mode 4 Presence of natural persons – by a service supplier of one Member, through the presence of natural persons of a Member in the territory of any other Member. Ex. A foreign national provides a service within A as an independent supplier (e.g., consultant, health worker) or employee of a service supplier (e.g. consultancy firm, hospital, construction company).

Cut the cost of doing business internationally. Encourage good governance Help countries in development Support the environment issues Contribute to peace and stability World Trade Organization’s Goals: International Organizations in Focus Reduce such tariff and non-tariff barriers to encourage international trade through its agreements and dispute settlement body. WTO’s Mission: International Organizations and their Objectives The WTO’s global system lowers trade barriers through negotiation and operates under the principle of non-discrimination The result is reduced costs of production(because imports used in production are cheaper), reduced prices of finished goods and services, more choice and ultimately a lower cost of living. The WTO’s system deals with these in two ways. One is by talking to countries and negotiating rules that are acceptable to all. The other is by settling disputes about whether countries are playing by those agreed rules.

With stability and predictability, investment is encouraged Promising fair competition Encouraging Development and Economic Reform Special and differential treatment International Organizations and Global Trade Theories Mercantilist Theory From the 16th to 18th century, economists believed in mercantilism i.e. The amount of wealth in the world is static. A nation’s wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and receiving payments in gold, silver and precious metals, a principle that aligns with the objectives of institutions like the World Bank. Therefore, any import was seen as a loss of the nation’s wealth in gold payment. So, colonial powers tried to flood their colonies with readymade goods but always prevented entry of goods in their home country. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching International Organizations and Adam Smith’s Cost Advantage Theory Output per one laborer India China Wheat 30kg 10kg Rice 10kg 15kg India has an absolute cost advantage over China in wheat production. So, India should focus on producing more wheat, and import rice from China. India should not try to be a ‘rice production specialist’. Adam Smith’s theory assumes – There are no production costs except laborers No transport cost There is free trade (no taxes on import exports) David Ricardo’s Theory of Comparative/Relative Cost Advantage (1817) How many workers required to produce → 1-meter textile 1 bottle of wine France 10 workers 12 workers England 9 workers 8 workers Here, we can see England requires less workers than France to produce wine and 8 workers textiles. So, as per Adam Smith’s absolute cost advantage, England should not import anything from France! But, if plotted on graphs, it will appear that for England per unit labor cost to produce 1 meter textile is (relatively) cheaper than 1 bottle of wine. So, England should shift domestic English wine workers towards textiles. England should export textile to France and import wine from France. England should not try to become a ‘Wine production specialist’.

USA’s Boeing company exporting Jet planes. Labour-Abundant Country Labour-Abundant Countries will export labor-intensive goods. E.g. India exports cotton (and imports jet planes from the USA). WTO → FUNCTIONS Today all countries try to protect domestic industries against foreign imports by creating two types of barriers against the international trade: Tariff Barriers Against International Trade: Impact and Considerations within International Organizations Tariff Barriers: Increasing the taxes, duties, cess, surcharge, on imported goods and services e.g. Trump imposed 25% custom duty on imported steel. CVD Two scenarios when foreign goods will appear cheaper to Indians than domestic goods: If foreign country is giving subsidies to their exporters and / or If Indian government imposes higher amount of taxes, cess or surcharge on the locally manufactured products then Indian Govt tries to protect local (domestic) industry by imposing Countervailing Duty (CVD), Special Countervailing Duty, Additional Customs Duty on imported items. These duties have been removed in India. Now imported items are subjected to [Basic Customs Duty + Social Welfare Surcharge on it] + IGST Anti-Dumping Duty If China exports goods to India at a price below their normal price in domestic Chinese market or at a price below their cost of production- then it is termed as “Dumping” Then, India’s commerce ministry → Directorate General of Trade Remedies : (DGTR) investigates → recommends the Finance ministry to impose “Anti-Dumping Duty” on such imported items. E.g. $185 on every one tonne of imported Chinese Steel, Then its prices will become equivalent to India Steel, thus Indian steel industry will be protected. Not yet abolished in India. They’re subjected to WTO norms. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Non-Tariff Barriers against international trade: Considerations within International Organizations & World Bank If USA does not increase import taxes but plays other tricks like: Subsidies to domestic industries: Giving free electricity to Detroit car manufacturers. or the USA govt. giving tax benefits & free car-insurance to American residents for buying American made cars. Public Procurement: Making a rule that only American companies can fill up tender for supplying stationery, school bags etc. in government schemes. Technical Barriers to Trade: e.g. imported mango must have 0% pesticides residue, imported cars must have airbags for each passenger. Quota system: e.g. not more than 50 metric tonnes of steel can be imported from a single foreign country. WTO Disputes: India vs. USA – Perspectives within International Organizations India’s Solar procurement preference: USA argued India’s Jawaharlal Nehru Solar Mission gave public procurement preference & subsidy to India – made solar panels thus creating a non-tariff barrier for American solar panels. India lost the case at WTO & was forced to withdraw such barriers (2017). However, USA still alleges that India is playing mischief in solar schemes by giving preference to local manufacturers over American-made products (2018) , prompting considerations within the framework of international organizations. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Ban on American Poultry In 2007, India had imposed the ban on American poultry under the Indian Livestock Importation Act, 1898 stating avian influenza / bird flu danger in India, considering recommendations within the framework of international organizations The USA claimed there was no scientific basis – India merely banned us to protect local poultry’ business interest. WTO ruled in favor of the USA (2016). But India has only allowed partial import of poultry from selected states of USA so, USA has demanded $450 million compensation from Indian Govt. at WTO (2018). India’s Export Incentive Schemes: Insights from International Organizations 2018: USA complained to the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) that India is running various export incentive schemes such as: Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) Export Oriented Units (EOU) Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG). Electronics Hardware Technology Parks (EHTP) Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Under such schemes India gives tax reliefs / subsidies to its exporters. So, it is creating tariffs and non-tariff barriers against American companies, & thus India is violating the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). India’s position is “We will phase out these schemes after 8 years from 2017 (e. around 2025). Since we are a developing country, we should be given such a relaxed deadline under the SCM agreement.” 2019-Oct: WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) ordered in favor of the USA and ordered India to stop such schemes within the next 90-180 days. 2019-Nov: India goes to WTO Appellate Body to undo DSB’s order. WTO Appellate Body members are appointed by the WTO members by consensus, (i.e. no member-nation should formally object to a candidate’s name). USA is presently opposing the appointment of new members in the Appellate Body. So, the body is under-staffed/ dysfunctional. 2020-Mar: Indian Commerce Minister says, “we will not implement WTO’s dispute panel orders, because the appellate body is not functioning so our appeal is pending.” Enroll now for UPSC Online Course WTO and Key Agreements: Perspectives from International Organizations Objective Agreement(s) Reduce the tariff barriers 1.

(CSE-2016) WTO affairs SAARC affairs UNFCCC India-EU negotiations Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Q. The terms ‘Agreement on Agriculture’, ‘SPS Agreement and ‘Peace Clause’ are in the context of affairs of the________ (CSE-2015) Food and Agriculture Organization UN Framework Conference on Climate Change World Trade Organization United Nations Environment Programme TRIPS & TRIMS The WTO’s intellectual property agreement amounts to rules for trade and investment in ideas and creativity. The rules, established by an international organization,state how copyrights, patents, trademarks, geographical names used to identify products, industrial designs, integrated circuit layout-designs and undisclosed information such as trade secrets — “intellectual property” — should be protected when trade is involved. The basic principles related to the Intellectual Property agreements are mentioned in “The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)”. TRIPS The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of intellectual property (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations. TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994 and is administered by the WTO. TRIMS Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) Under TRIMs, the WTO names the list of investment measures that discriminates foreign investment and hence violates the basic WTO principle of National Treatment. These measures include – local content requirement, domestic employment, technology transfer requirement etc The objective of TRIMs is to ensure fair treatment of investment in all member countries. As per the TRIMs Agreement, members are required to notify the WTO Council for Trade in Goods of their existing TRIMs that are inconsistent with the agreement. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Compulsory Licensing: Understanding its Implications within the Framework of International Organizations Compulsory Licensing (CL) allows governments to license third parties(that is, parties other than the patent holders) to produce and market a patented product or process without the consent of patent owners. Any time after three years from date of sealing of a patent, application for compulsory license can be made, provided: Reasonable requirements of public have not been satisfied; Patented invention is not available to public at a reasonably affordable price; Patented inventions are not carried out in India. Compulsory Licencing is regulated under the Indian Patent Act, 1970. The TRIPS does not specifically list the reasons that might be used to justify compulsory licensing. However, the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, an international organization confirms that countries are free to determine the grounds for granting compulsory licenses, and to determine what constitutes a national emergency. Recently, the CPI (Marxist) party has suggested that the government shall issue Compulsory Licensing for the manufacturing of a Generic version of Ramdev Sivir which is being used to treat Covid-19 patients. Generic medicines and vaccinations are copies of originally researched drugs, but at much lower prices. “Evergreening” of patents “Evergreening,” is referred to the practice whereby pharmaceutical firms extend the patent life of a drug by obtaining additional 20-year patents for minor reformulations or other iterations of the drug, without necessarily increasing the therapeutic efficacy. However it has become a practice in the pharmaceutical industry where on one hand innumerable patients are struggling to afford the high priced patented drugs, while on the other hand innovators are struggling to give immortal value to their creation. These dynamics raise concerns within the framework of international organizations. ” Enroll now for Online Course Parallel Imports A parallel import is a non-counterfeit product imported from another country without the permission of the intellectual property owner. Parallel imports are often referred to as gray products and are implicated in issues of international trade and intellectual property. Parallel importing is based on the concept of exhaustion of intellectual property rights. According to this concept, when the product is first launched on the market in a particular jurisdiction, parallel importation is authorized to all residents in the state in question. Some countries allow it but others do not. Parallel importing of pharmaceuticals reduces the price of pharmaceuticals by introducing competition. TRIPS agreement in Article 6 states that this practice cannot be challenged under the WTO dispute settlement system and so is effectively a matter of national discretion. The practice of parallel importing is often advocated in the case of software, music, printed texts and electronic products. International Organization in WTO: Negotiations, Summits, and Packages Most Favored Nation (MFN)- If a country grants someone a special favor (such as a lower customs duty rate for one of their products) then it must do the same for all other WTO members. This principle is known as most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment. Suppose India levies 15% custom duty on imported laptops from any country. But, later India-Japan trade agreement is signed wherein Japanese laptops are subjected to only 5% custom duty in India. Then implies Japan has become the Most Favored Nation for India (as far as the laptop trade is concerned). WTO agreements,overseen by an international organization, require that whatever treatment is being given to the MFN, must also be extended to all other member countries. A member should not discriminate between its trading partners. (So even imported Pakistani laptops should be subjected to 5% custom duty only, if India is charging that % on Japanese). But in practice, MFN is not implemented in letter and spirit by the members. 1996: India granted MFN status to Pakistan but Pakistan didn’t reciprocate (mainly) due to their local textile industrialists’ lobby who feared competition from Indian textile imports. In February 2019, India, in response to the Pulwama attack on CRPF personnel, withdrew the Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for Pakistan. Additionally, an international organization notes that India also increased the customs duty by 200% on goods originating from Pakistan. Since Pakistan is not giving India MFN treatment. So, there is no ‘legal-compulsion’ in India to give them MFN status. Even if Pakistan complained to the WTO’s dispute redressal panel, it’ll lose the case.

For example – Somalia, Ethiopia, Congo, Central African Republic, Bhutan, Bangladesh etc. Least Developed Countries’ economic growth can improve if they are able to export more. So, WTO agreements permit other countries to give duty free quota free access to exports from LDC. and that is not considered as a violation of any other agreement. For instance, if India levied 0% custom duty on Somalian laptops, India would not be required to give the same treatment to Japanese laptops under the “MFN norm”, Because Japan is not an LDC. First world countries Also known as Advanced Economies (AE), Developed Countries, such as USA, Canada, France and Germany etc. Second world countries USSR and its neighboring European countries which were under the influence of Communist Socialist ideologies. However, the term has become defunct with the collapse of the USSR. Third world countries Developing countries, Emerging market economies (EME) – India, China, Mexico, Brazil etc. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Domestic Subsidies are categorized into 3 boxes: Green Box Subsidies which are no or least market distorting includes measures decoupled from output such as income-support payments (decoupled income support), safety – net programs, payments under environmental programs, and agricultural research and development subsidies. Blue Box Only ‘Production limiting Subsidies’ under this are allowed. They cover payments based on acreage, yield, or number of livestock in a base year. Amber Box Those subsidies which are trade distorting and need to be curbed. The Amber Box contains a category of domestic support that is scheduled for reduction based on a formula called the “Aggregate Measure of Support” (AMS). The AMS is the amount of money spent by governments on agricultural production, except for those contained in the Blue Box, Green Box and ‘de minimis’. “De minimis” provision: Under this provision developed countries are allowed to maintain trade distorting subsidies or ‘Amber box’ subsidies to a level of 5% of total value of agricultural output. For developing countries this figure was 10%. So far India’s subsidies are below this limit, but it is growing constantly and is likely to cross the 10% level allowed by de Minimise provision, as per the guidelines of the International Organization. International Organization: Addressing Controversies between 1st and 3rd World at WTO: Doha Development Round (Qatar) – 2001: 3rd World Perspectives in WTO Negotiations with International Organization Considerations In WTO’s “Doha development agenda” (2001) negotiations, the 3rd world countries wanted following: the 1st world should liberalize their trade regulation further so that 3rd world’s goods and services can enter more easily in the first world’s domestic markets. The World Bank suggests that the 3rd world should be allowed to keep various barriers to slow down the entry of 1st world agriculture, manufactured goods and service exports in their domestic market. The 1st world should give financial and technical assistance to the 3rd world. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching The USA and European countries would not agree to this. So, the Doha round of negotiation continues without conclusion. And in future summits the USA/EU would want WTO officials to begin negotiations on the new matters lucrative to their MNCs (like ICT, E-Commerce) whereas 3rd world nations, in accordance with the International Organization, will continue to insist that Doha round negotiations must be concluded first. International Organization and National Treatment in WTO: Equality for Foreign and Domestic Goods National treatment implies treating foreigners and locals equallyImported and locally-produced goods should be treated equally — at least after the foreign goods have entered the market. The same should apply to foreign and domestic services, and to foreign and local trademarks, copyrights and patents. This principle of “national treatment” (giving others the same treatment as one’s own nationals) is also found in all the three main WTO agreements (Article 3 of GATT, Article 17 of GATS and Article 3 of TRIPS), although once again the principle is handled slightly differently in each of these. National treatment only applies once a product, service or item of intellectual property has entered the market. Therefore, charging customs duty on an import is not a violation of national treatment even if locally-produced products are not charged an equivalent tax, as considered within the framework of international organizations. “Special And Differential Treatment Provisions within the framework of international organizations” The WTO agreements contain special provisions which give developing countries special rights and allow other members to treat them more favorably. These are “special and differential treatment provisions” (abbreviated as S&D or SDT). The special provisions include: Longer time periods for implementing agreements and commitments. Measures to increase trading opportunities for these countries. Provisions requiring all WTO members to safeguard the trade interests of developing countries within the framework of international organizations. Support to help developing countries build the infrastructure to undertake WTO work, handle disputes, and implement technical standards. Provisions related to least-developed country (LDC) members Enroll now for UPSC Online Course In the Doha Declaration, ministers agreed that all special and differential treatment provisions should be reviewed, in order to strengthen them and make them more precise, effective and operational, as per the suggestions from the World Bank. WTO’s Food Subsidies & Peace Clause: Phases of International Organization Under WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), 1st world and 3rd world countries are required to limit their food-subsidies to 5% and 10% respectively to the value of their agriculture production, as considered within the framework of international organizations. Agreement on Agriculture Green Decoupled from production and prices For research, implementation of structural prog, disaster relief Blue Trade distortionary but limits production. Encouraging production for limited time period Amber Trade Distortionary like MSP But in 1986, India’s agricultural production was far lower than the USA so even in absolute quantitative terms USA’s 5% will be much bigger than India’s 10%. 1st world countries are able to give larger amounts of food subsidies to their farmers and facilitate their export to 3rd world countries at much cheaper price, ruining local farmers. Further, India has a large population of poor farmers who require Govt support in the form of subsidies & procurement at Minimum support prices (MSP). India also has a large number of malnourished poor families who need subsidized food grains under National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013. 2013 – At WTO’s ministerial conference at Bali (Indonesia), India refused to sign any new agreements until this food subsidy issue was resolved.

If there is a surge of cheap agro exports from 1st world to 3rd world, then 3rd world countries will have the right to temporarily increase tariff / taxes on them, to protect their local farmers, popularly known as “Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM), taking into consideration the recommendations of the World Bank.” 1996 – Information Technology Agreement (ITA) plurilateral agreement (i.e. not signed by all member nations) endorsed by the International Organization. Agreement aims to abolish import export taxes on about 200 IT products. We will try to get more members to sign this, so global IT-trade can increase. Technical reforms to help the exports from Least Developed Countries (LDC). WTO and International Organization: Key Developments and Ongoing Challenges The 11th WTO Ministerial conference 2017 at Buenos Aires, Argentina failed to deliver any notable and substantial package because : Food subsidy related reforms remained inconclusive because neither India – China nor USA-EU were willing to compromise. So, in reality the ‘Peace clause’ is extended for an infinite period– which is not a good thing because large amounts of food subsidies given on (chemical) fertilizers harm the environment. USA-EU were more keen for a new agreement on e-commerce but India-China, in alignment with the stance of the International Organization, opposed that such agreements will benefit 1st world countries more (because they’ve Amazon, Walmart, Facebook etc) than 3rd world countries. India insisted that first finish negotiations of the original Doha agenda subjects, before proposing such new topics like e-commerce. Members also failed to conclude negotiations related to Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM), investment facilitation, MSME etc.. As a result, this conference ended without a joint declaration by the members. Enroll now for Online Course Why has India opposed the Buenos Aires Declaration? India held that it strongly supports gender equality and is very much in favor of promoting gender issues but it cannot concur with the view that gender is a trade-related issue. WTO is a purely trade-related body and not a forum to discuss gender, so gender-related discussions should take place at appropriate international organizations. It also held that developed countries have high standards in gender- related policies as compared to developing or least developed countries (LDC). Hence the proposition to link gender and trade agreed then developed nations will curb exports from developing world using ‘gender’ issues as non-trade barriers. G-33 (Group of 33) The Group of 33 developing countries, including India and China , has proposed to include procurement of food products from farmers at minimum support price (MSP) and their distribution at subsidized rates to the poor in the global rules of agriculture . Subsidies on account of these programmes should not be included in the category of trade-distorting subsidies that disrupt markets and prices of food items, the grouping has said in its proposal on a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security. G33 includes 47 developing and least developed countries. It has called for an amendment in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) because current rules suggest a fixed subsidy of 10% for food procurement from farmers to feed the poor. The existing rule also uses an old methodology for subsidy calculation that does not account for inflation and is based on a price index of 1986-88. Public stockholding for food security is critical for developing countries where agriculture is dependent on rains, agricultural markets are imperfect and they provide subsidized food grains to their poor, recognizing the role of the International Organization, particularly the World Bank, in supporting such initiatives.

Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on member-states’ policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labeling) as well as animal and plant health (phyto-sanitation) with respect to imported pests and diseases. these measures may sometimes go beyond what is needed to protect such objectives and be used to shield domestic producers from foreign competition Indian Alphonso by EU Geographical Indications: Global Recognition and Protection by International Organizations Geographical indications are place names (in some countries also words associated with a place) used to identify products that come from these places and have specific characteristics (for example, “Champagne”, “Tequila” or “Roquefort”). A geographical indication or GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. Under the TRIPS Agreement, all geographical indications have to be protected at least to avoid misleading the public and to prevent unfair competition (Article 22). This is the only intellectual property issue that is definitely part of the Doha negotiations. Geographical Indications are part of the intellectual property rights that come under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. In India, Geographical Indications registration is administered by the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act of 1999. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching In the Way Ahead: Strengthening Developing Countries in WTO with International Organization Considerations Need of free trade is required more by developing countries like India than developed countries. So Developing countries must work collaboratively to strengthen WTO There is a need to collaborate effectively and learn from the past experiences when India and China led the developing countries in environmental forums, garnering funds in the form of GCF. There is need for the structural reforms in the WTO functioning as multilateral trading system Despite WTO being a democratic organization, there is a need to make it more effective in protecting the interests of small nations against stronger countries. The process of retaliation is ineffective and too impractical for smaller players. WTO needs to strengthen the dispute settlement mechanism as there are issues in appointment of judges in new appellate body Lastly, WTO needs to enhance discussion mechanism by introducing wider consultations. It has been a long standing complaint by the smaller participants that the consultations or decision making is limited to the green room of DG of WTO. TRADE AGREEMENTS TYPES: Partial Scope Agreement (PSA): Trade between two countries for a small list of goods @reduced tariffs. Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) / Free Trade Agreement (FTA): Member à lower tariff; non-members: regular tariff. All FTAs are not the same. Tariff and list of allowed goods/services could vary depending on country to country. Depending on the number of participants it can be bilateral or multilateral or regional or global (e.g. WTO). If countries go further beyond just lower tariffs e.g. relaxed norms for entry of foreign investment and foreign workers, then it becomes Comprehensive Economic partnership Agreement (CEPA) or Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) Customs Union (CU): FTA in which members apply a common external tariff (CET) for non- members. E.g. East African Community (EAC). Caribbean Community Common Market (CM): Customs union where factors of production (capital, labor) can move freely amongst members e.g. MERCOSUR- S. America. Economic Union (EU): Common market where member countries keep common currency & tariff. Allow entry of goods, services, capital and labor among themselves with minimum restrictions. They decide their fiscal policies and diplomatic policies through a common parliament ‘European Parliament’, and their monetary policies through a common central bank – ‘European Central Bank’. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Free Trade Agreements (FTAs): Understanding TPP and Implications within International Organizations Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) The USA proposed a free trade agreement among 12 countries: US, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. Aimed to have lower tariffs for participant countries, easier norms for labor, environment and investment. 2016: President Trump withdrew from the negotiation claiming, “TPP will take away jobs from the USA because companies will set up factories in Mexico where labor is cheaper, and then such cheap products will be dumped in the USA, yet we will not be able to impose heavy taxes on them.” So TPP has become defunct. TPP-11 or CPTPP The USA-led TPP could not materialize, but some of the nations in the Pacific region separately worked out a ‘Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans- Pacific Partnership’ (CPT or commonly called TPP-11) in 2018-Dec. Transatlantic Trade and Investment Pact (TTIP): An Overview with International Organization Considerations Proposed free trade agreement between USA & EU with objectives similar to TPP– reduce tariff, easier entry of foreign investment etc. Negotiations are ongoing but it is not yet signed mainly due to opposition from the European Union side. E.g. In USA’s Farm, Dairy and Meat industry the standards related to pesticide residue, pathogens, antibiotics, growth hormones, genetically modified (GM) crops etc. are slightly lower than EU. So, EU’s animal rights & environmental groups worried it will lead to unrestricted flow of those “harmful” products from USA to Europe. EU has strict norms on private companies to cut their emissions and compulsorily invest in renewable energy. In USA such norms are relaxed. EU’s environmental groups don’t want such ‘polluting US companies’ to profit via exporting to EU. USA wants EU nations to cut down the subsidies and preferences given to EU’s state owned enterprises (SOE) / PSUs. The EU civil rights / labour rights group fear it will lead to privatization of health, education, and insurance companies which will cause unemployment of PSU-workers, and when pvt. MNCs are providing such essential services it will become unaffordable for many poor citizens. USA had been lobbying for TPP and TTIP because USA is disillusioned with the WTO– wherein India, China and other emerging economies have equal voting rights and have become more assertive, so USA and its MNCs are not gaining much benefit out of WTO led agreements. But, If TPP/TTIP materialized, it’d harm Asian economies exports towards the US/EU so to compensate for that loss, Asian economies came up with their own idea RCEP. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes RCEP: International Organization, World Bank, and Regional Economic Partnership RCEP is a proposed free-trade agreement between the 10 ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia) and their six Free-Trade Agreements partners Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and S. Korea, with considerations from the World Bank Collectively, these countries command 25% of global GDP, 30% of global trade. RCEP requires them to reduce the tariff and non-tariff barriers against each other, encourage investments, economic and technical cooperation, protect Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) etc. This will boost trade, economic growth and employment in each of these countries, RCEP: Understanding India’s Decision Not to Join – Reasons (2019) with World Bank Perspective India already has over a $100 billion trade deficit with RCEP countries. Out of this, China alone accounts for a $54 billion trade deficit. So India had following apprehensions about this agreement. China: RCEP will result in increased flow of (Cheap) Chinese manufactured & electronic goods → Indian MSME, automobile, steel industries harmed → So, India wanted separate levels of customs duty against Chinese imports. Dairy: India is among the largest producers of milk but our speciality is mostly in the liquid products whereas New Zealand is renowned for its solid products (milk powder, butter, cheese etc.) with the support and considerations of the World Bank. These solid dairy products have a longer shelf-life & easier to transport over long-distance. So if trade-barriers are removed, India will be flooded with cheap dairy products which leads to suffering of Indian farmers & dairy entrepreneurs. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Agriculture: Southern India’s plantation farmers are afraid of cheaper tea, coffee, rubber, cardamom and pepper from Malaysia, Indonesia & other RCEP nations. India wanted an Automatic Trigger Safeguard Mechanism (ATSM) to protect itself from surge in imports. (e.g. raise customs duty by “x%” on imported products from “y” country if “z” situation occurs). Ratchet Obligation: It means a nation cannot go back/undo its commitments under the RCEP agreement. India wants certain exemptions Base Year for tax cuts: India wants a base year for tax-cuts fixed in 2019 instead of 2014. Because since 2014, India has raised customs duties on over 3,500 products. Data localisation: India wants all RCEP countries to have the rights to protect data & prohibit cross-border data flow in the national interest.For this reason, India, in alignment with international organizations, including the World Bank, declined to sign the G20 Osaka declaration on cross-border data flow. 2019-Nov: RCEP summit at Bangkok, Thailand. Here, Indian demands were not agreeable to the majority of other members. So, India announced not to join the RCEP Agreement. RCEP: Assessing India’s Non-participation and World Bank’s Perspective on Rules of Origin in International Trade RCEP: Conclusion While it is true that India could have gained in certain export-sectors by signing the RCEP Agreement, its present format did not fully address India’s issues and concerns regarding the protection of the domestic industry. So we’ve opted not to sign it. The remaining member-nations have planned to sign the RCEP agreement in 2020 and they are trying to convince India to get onboard. India has not permanently shut the doors for negotiation. In future we may sign it, if our concerns are addressed. Economic Survey 2015-16: Observations about India’s Trade Agreements · India has signed 40+ trade agreements with various countries, our global trade has improved but more on the import side than export side. · RCEP, TTIP, TPP are mega regional agreements that will undermine the WTO processes. India must prepare for this changing world. India should shed its “big but poor” dilemma– i.e. We’ve to grow up from the mentality that “Our India is poor nation we must protect farmers & MSME so we have moral right to impose tariff and non-tariff barriers on US/EU goods/services & yet US/EU must allow our goods/services into their countries without any barriers” · It’s for this reason, India-European Broad-Based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) is not reaching a conclusion. International trade is a give-and-take relationship we’ve to reduce our trade barriers only then we can expect them to reduce their trade barriers. This principle aligns with the goals promoted by international organizations. ES20: Observations about India’s Trade Agreements · Critiques allege that most of India’s FTAs have not worked in “India’s favor.” e.g. India’s FTA with S. Korea, Japan and Sri Lanka = % increase in imports >> are higher than % increase of exports. · The ES20 concluded that overall India has gained in terms of increase in exports by signing FTAs. (table) Budget-2020: FTA ‘rules of origin’ · 1998: India – Sri Lanka FTA. So ink manufactured in Sri Lanka = 0% Indian customs duty when imported in India. · But sometimes Chinese company manufacture ink bottles in China, transports to its Sri Lankan company → Sri Lanka’s company pastes a label “this bottle manufactured in Sri-Lanka” → sell them in India at 0% customs duty. · So, FTA agreements contain ‘rules of origin’. Which requires that minimum x% manufacturing/processing/value addition must be done in originating country (SriLanka in our example) before it’s eligible for 0% customs duty. · Originating country (SriLanka) cannot dump goods from some third country (China) in the Indian market by just putting a label on it. Understanding Rules of Origin: Significance in Global Trade and International Organization Perspectives Determining where a product comes from is no longer easy when raw materials and parts criss-cross the globe to be used as inputs in scattered manufacturing plants. Rules of origin are therefore needed to attribute one country of origin to each product. They are the criteria used to define where a product was made and are important for implementing other trade policy measures, including trade preferences (preferential rules of origin), quotas, anti-dumping measures, and countervailing duties, in accordance with guidelines set by the International Organization.

BURNING ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE International Organization Perspectives on Protectionism and Trade Wars Protectionism connotes the use of tariff and non-tariff barriers to protect the local industry against foreign competition. Trade war happens when two / more nations attack each other’s exports through tariff and non-tariff barriers. 2017: The USA had a $375 billion trade deficit with China. Cheap import from China causes domestic American manufacturers to suffer. US companies outsourcing to China which results in unemployment of American workers. 2018: Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported steel, semiconductors, chemicals, plastics, motorbikes and electric scooters etc. from China. So, China retaliated by hiking tariffs on imported American soybean & other food products, chemicals, medical equipment & vehicles, in consideration of guidelines provided by the International Organization. Both also filed complaints against each other at WTO. The EU is also making similar protectionist moves against China and India.

Earlier India had imposed a ban on its export to ensure supply for the Indian patients. But 2020-june: India lifted the ban, considering recommendations within the framework of international organizations. 1)export earning 2)soft-diplomacy: winning support of its friendly nations 2020-Aug Defense ministry has put 101 defense items in the negative import list i.e. they will be purchased from local manufacturers. They’ll not be imported e.g. Multi barrel rocket launchers, assault rifles, radars. Benefit – Local industry will get contracts worth ₹4 lakh cr. → Make in India, Atma-Nirbhar, reducing CAD International Organization Dynamics: Protectionism and Indian Government Procurement Atma-Nirbhar: PM asked the nation to be ” vocal for local “ (to promote local goods) with an aim to make India self-sufficient in every way. So, in Government procurement tenders up to ₹200 crore, foreign (global) companies will not be allowed to apply. This will help Indian Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) and large Indian companies to revive business through increased purchase from the Government. USA’s Special 301 Report: Perspectives from International Organizations Annual report that lists the countries who are harming the Intellectual Property Rights – copyrights, patents and trademarks of American companies. These countries are classified into categories such as “Priority Foreign Country” (Most dangerous)> “Priority Watch List” > “Watch List” etc. Depending on the classification, the USA will complain to the WTO and / or spend money on those countries to reduce the piracy (e.g. training and capacity building of Russian police officers & China’s cybercrime courts etc.), in alignment with recommendations from the International Organization. 2018: India, Russia, China etc. are on priority watchlist. Mainly because of their hackers, movie piracy, counterfeit products; India because of its drug patent norms & NPPA which reduce the profitability of US pharma companies’ patented drugs. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course USA’s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) List: World Bank and International Trade Perspective If a developing country’s name is in this list, its exports will be subjected to zero/lower import duties in the USA (for selected products only). 2019: Trump removed India from GSP list, citing India has imposed heavy import duties on Harley Davidson bikes and other American exports. As such most of the Indian exported goods to the USA are not in the GSP list in the first place, so this blacklisting will not harm India much, albeit, Indian textile companies are worried that GSP-removal will make Indian garments more expensive in the USA. USA Reciprocal Trade Act 2019: Considerations within International Organizations 2019: United States Reciprocal Trade Bill was introduced in the American parliament (US congress) If the partner nation has imposed a high level of tariff/non-tariff barriers on American products, then: The US President can unilaterally increase the taxes on imported products of that trading country. The US President can even ‘undo’ his commitment from the free trade agreements with that country. If the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of American products are not respected/enforced in a country → the US President, with considerations from the International Organization, can raise taxes on imported products from that country. India-USA Limited Trade Deal: Exploring International Organization Dynamics 2020-Jul: India and USA are negotiating for a ‘limited trade deal’ i.e. only for selected commodities taxes may be decreased. Basically, they’re looking for following international organization considerations. India should reduce taxes à on American farm & dairy products, pharmaceuticals, electronics etc USA should reduce taxes à on Indian steel & Aluminium etc, and USA should restore India’s name in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Impact of US/EU/China Trade War on India: Considerations within World Bank and International Organizations Previous economic surveys observed: US’s protectionism is targeted more towards Chinese goods than towards Indian services (IT/BPO) because of their local political / vote bank perception that Chinese manufacturing industries are more responsible for the loss of American jobs than Indian call-centers. So, India need not worry excessively. Besides, Chinese tariffs on the USA creates opportunities for India to export its soyabean, cars, medical equipment to China. The Commerce Ministry has recorded growth in over 300+ Indian exports including vulcanized rubber, paper, copper wires, electrodes, natural honey and pipes to China, aligning with international organization considerations. Similarly, the USA’s 25% import duty on Chinese seafood has made American consumers shift to Indian frozen shrimps which don’t attract such large duties in the USA. This positive trend has been acknowledged and observed within the framework of international organizations. However, with the rise of nationalistic political groups in the 1st world nations, India will face following challenges → 1st world nations’ local industrial groups keep pressuring their governments to impose more tariffs on Indian fisheries, textile and pharma sectors. With the fall in (overall) exports of India, there has been a glut in the supply of commodities in the domestic market, resulting in inflation levels falling below 3%. According to the Phillips curve, there is an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. This could pose a challenge to our economy in the days ahead. 1st world nations tighten their visa / immigration policies – NRIs suffer. Protectionism: Conclusion Protectionism has a mixed impact on Indian macroeconomic stability because while it helped boost Indian exports in some sectors (seafood & soybean), it has harmed the other sectors., it has harmed the other sectors, necessitating considerations within the framework of international organizations. Protectionism will only hurt the US economy & Chinese economy in the long run. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching BREXIT (BRITAIN EXIT) TIMELINE DEVELOPMENT 1993 · The Maastricht Treaty formed the European Union, a political and economic union to allow easy movement of goods, services, and citizens among themselves. 2002 · The EU introduced its common currency, Euro. Although Britain was an EU member, it continued with its own currency ‘Pound Sterling’ · Later, Britain’s political parties campaigned that: o migrant workers from other EU countries could result in job loss for local Britishers. · 2) The EU framework is harming our economic and foreign diplomacy interests. 2016 · Britain held a referendum & asked its citizens “whether Britain should exit or remain in the European Union?” 52% voted yes, 48% voted no. 2017 · Britain invokes Article 50 of Lisbon Treaty, which gives them 2 years’ timeframe to work out a deal for exit / divorce. e.g. What happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK etc. How much money Britain must pay to the EU for leaving? Accordingly, Britain is scheduled to leave at +2 years = 29th March 2019. But there is internal political bickering among British parliamentarians on the terms of the exit deal. BREXIT Impact on India: Figure Out Changes with International Organizations BREXIT creates both opportunities and challenges for India. We will have to rebuild / update our trade agreements with both international organizations separately. With the rise of ‘nationalism’, ‘protectionism’ in Britain/EU → India’s textile, pharma, automobile exports may get hurt. Although Britain may ease its travel & education visa norms to attract Indian students for their college fees. The EU is planning to create a ‘Digital Single Market by 2020’ to cover digital marketing, E- commerce and telecommunications related services. Indian companies can provide backend services. British goods will no longer get easy entry into the EU, so they will try to export more towards India – because of India’s rising middle class & their growing purchasing power. We can demand reciprocal treatment e.g. “We will cut down tariffs for your ‘x’ list of goods, if you do the same for ‘y’ list of Indian goods.” Britain becomes ‘free’ of EU’s foreign policies so it may come up with new initiatives for Palestine, Middle East, Afghanistan etc. and to keep India on board, Britain may give some concessions e.g. “Vote in favor of our “x” resolution at UNGA & we’ll cut down tariffs on Indian goods by y% & will give a cheap infra. loan at z%”.

Otherwise MNCs will use data for their commercial benefits, harming privacy of citizens and sovereign interests of the States. (e.g. Huawei mobiles send their data to China, they may be hacked by Government-sponsored hackers to spy on India.), prompting the need for a global approach, as recognized by the International Organization. Such free flow of data may be misused for influencing public opinion through targeted advertisements and articles on social media. (e.g. The alleged Russian hand in Trump’s election.)

    "content": "AGRICULTURE To prepare for INDIAN ECONOMY for any competitive exam, aspirants have to know about Agriculture. It gives an idea of all the important topics for the IAS Exam and the Economy syllabus (GS-II). Important Agriculture terms are important from Economy perspectives in the UPSC exam. IAS aspirants should thoroughly understand their meaning and application, as questions can be asked from this static portion of the IAS Syllabus in both the UPSC Prelims and the UPSC Mains exams. Agriculture is the science, art and practice of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES Humans Engage in different activities to exploit natural resources and the most ancient of them are Primary activities. Primary activities are directly dependent on the environment and some of these activities are: Gathering and hunting: These are the oldest economic activities known. Gathering is practiced in regions with harsh climatic conditions. It often involves primitive societies, who extract both plants and animals to satisfy their needs for food, shelter and clothing. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course The main features of Gathering and Hunting activities are: Low Capital / Skill Investment Low Yield Per Person No Surplus in production Gathering is practised in the following areas of the world: Northern Canada, northern Eurasia and southern Chile (High Altitude Areas) Low latitude zones such as the Amazon Basin, tropical Africa, Northern fringe of Australia and the interior parts of Southeast Asia. Nomadic Herding or Pastoral Nomadism: Nomadic herding or pastoral nomadism is a primitive subsistence activity, in which the herders rely on animals for food, clothing, shelter, tools and transport. They move from one place to another along with their livestock, depending on the amount and quality of pastures and water, thus there is an irregular pattern of movement. It is different from Transhumance in which there is a fixed seasonal pattern of movement. Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little arable land, typically in the developing world. Of the estimated 30–40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide, most are found in central Asia and Northern and western regions of Africa, some parts of southern Africa and Tundra regions. In the Himalayas, Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gaddis and Bhotiyas are nomadic pastoralists who practice transhumance. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes TYPES OF AGRICULTURE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD Commercial Livestock Rearing: Commercial livestock rearing is more organised and capital-intensive activity in comparison to the Nomadic pastoralism. It is generally practised in permanent ranches . Products such as meat, wool, hides and skin are processed and packed scientifically and exported to different world markets emphasis is on breeding, genetic improvement, disease control and health care of the animals. New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and the United States of America are important countries where commercial livestock rearing is practised. Ranches refers to the large stock farms, usually fenced in, where animals are bred and reared on a commercial scale. They are found especially in the United States. Primary Subsistence Agriculture Subsistence agriculture is one in which the farming areas consume all, or nearly so, of the products locally grown. Subsistence agriculture Primitive Subsistence Agriculture Intensive Subsistence Agriculture Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Primitive Subsistence Agriculture This agriculture is also known as Shifting Cultivation Shifting Cultivation . It is widely practised by many tribes in the tropics, especially in Africa, south and Central America and south East Asia. When the vegetation is cleared by fire, and the ashes add to the fertility of the soil, it is called slash and burn agriculture. After sometime (3 to 5 years) the soil loses its fertility and the farmer shifts to other parts and clears other patches of the forest for cultivation.

If there is a surplus, then it is sold in the market. This type of farming is largely found in densely populated regions of monsoon Asia . Basically, there are two typ es of intensive subsistence agriculture. One is dominated by wet paddy and Another is dominated by crops such as sorghum, soybeans, sugarcane, maize, and vegetables. Areas of Intensive Subsistence Farming are : Tonkin Delta (Vietnam), lower Menem (Thailand); lower Irrawaddy (Myanmar); and the Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta, Eastern Coastal Plains (India). Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Mediterranean Agriculture It is practised within the Mediterranean climatic region where winter is wet and summer is dry. Farming is intensive, highly specialised and varied in the kind of crops raised. Many crops such as wheat, barley and vegetables are raised for domestic consumption, while others like citrus fruits, olives and grapes are grown mainly for export. That’s why this region is also called Orchard Lands of the World and it is the heart of the world’s wine industry. This region is famous around the world for the production of citrus fruits and grapes in the world. Viticulture or grape cultivation is a speciality of the Mediterranean region. Best quality wines in the world with distinctive flavours are produced from high quality grapes in various countries of this region. The inferior grapes are dried into raisins and currants. This region also produces olives and figs . The advantage of Mediterranean agriculture is that more valuable crops such as fruits and vegetables are grown in winters when there is great demand in European and North American markets. Plantation Agriculture This type of farming has developed in parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America, where the influence of the Europeans have been important during the colonial period. Though practiced over a rather small area, this type of farming is quite important in terms of its commercial value . Tea, coffee, rubber and oil palm are the major products of this type of farming. Most of the plantations were developed to provide some of the important tropical crops to the European markets. Important plantation regions: Tea gardens in India and Sri Lanka Banana and sugar plantations in the West Indies Coffee plantations in Brazil Rubber in Malaysia This is a highly capital-intensive farming and most of the crops are tree crops. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL GRAIN CULTIVATION This type of agriculture system is mainly practiced in the Eurasian steppes in regions of chernozem soil, Canadian and American Prairies, the Pampas of Argentina, the Veld of South Africa , the Australian Downs and the Canterbury Plain of New Zealand . The main characteristics of this type of agriculture are: highly mechanized cultivation farms are very large predominance of wheat low yield per acre but yield per capita is high. MIXED FARMING This type of agricultural system is found in the highly developed parts of the world : north-western Europe, eastern North America, Russia, Ukraine, and the temperate latitudes of parts of the southern continents. Farming is very intensive and sometimes highly specialized. Traditionally, farmers have practised a mixed economy by raising animals and growing crops on the same farm. Mixed farming is characterised by high capital expenditure on farm machinery and building , extensive use of chemical fertilisers and green manures and also by the skill and expertise of the farmers. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching DAIRY FARMING Dairy is the most advanced and efficient type of rearing of milch animals. It is highly capital intensive. Animal sheds, storage facilities for fodder, feeding and milking machines add to the cost of dairy farming. Special emphasis is laid on cattle breeding, health care and veterinary services. It is highly labour intensive as it involves rigorous care in feeding and milching . There is no off season during the year as in the case of crop raising. It is practised mainly near urban and industrial centres which provide neighbourhood markets for fresh milk and dairy products. The development of transportation, refrigeration, pasteurisation and other preservation processes have increased the duration of shortage of various dairy products. MARKET GARDENING AND HORTICULTURE It is practised mainly in the same region as that of mixed farming that consists of cultivation of vegetables, fruit and flowers solely for the urban market. It is well-developed in the densely populated industrial districts of north-western Europe (Britain, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany) and in North-Eastern USA. The regions where farmers specialise in vegetables only, the farming is known as truck farming . The distance of truck farms from the market is governed by the distance that a truck can cover overnight, hence the name truck farming. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course FACTORY FARMING Factory farming is a method of mass food production in which animals are kept in very confined areas in order to get the best possible profit. This farming is particularly concentrated in Developed countries like USA, European nations, Australia etc. CO-OPERATIVE FARMING A group of farmers form a co-operative society by pooling in their resources voluntarily for more efficient and profitable farming. Individual farms remain intact and farming is a matter of cooperative initiative. Co-operative societies help farmers , to procure all important inputs of farming, sell the products at the most favourable terms and help in processing of quality products at cheaper rates. Co-operative movement originated over a century ago and has been successful in many western European countries like Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Italy etc. In Denmark , the movement has been so successful that practically every farmer is a member of a co-operative. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes COLLECTIVE FARMING The basic principle behind this type of farming is based on social ownership of the means of production and collective labour . Collective farming or the model of Kolkhoz was introduced in the erstwhile Soviet Union to improve upon the inefficiency of the previous methods of agriculture and to boost agricultural production for self-sufficiency. The farmers used to pool in all their resources like land, livestock and labour. However, they were allowed to retain very small plots to grow crops in order to meet their daily requirements. Yearly targets were set by the government and the produce was also sold to the state at fixed prices. Produce in excess of the fixed amount was distributed among the members or sold in the market . The farmers had to pay taxes on the farm produce, hired machinery etc. Members were paid according to the nature of the work allotted to them by the farm management. Exceptional work was rewarded in cash or kind . This type of farming was introduced in the former Soviet Union under the socialist regime which was adopted by the socialist countries. After its collapse, these have already been modified. INDIAN AGRICULTURE INTRODUCTION India is an agricultural economy where 49% of the people depend directly or indirectly on agriculture. Net sown area still accounts for about 47% of the total land area of India. In India, over 80 per cent of water is used in irrigation. Of the net sown area of around 140 million hectares (Mn ha), close to half (68.4 Mn ha) is irrigated (2019) Major states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha among others are still majorly dependent on Agriculture. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching GDP compositions in 2018-19 are as follows (ES2020) Agriculture (16.5%) Services (55.3%) Industry (28.6%) Union Territories of India Facts/Data related to Agriculture sector Share of agriculture and allied sectors in Gross Value Addition (GVA) has declined from 18.2 percent in 2014-15 to 16.5 percent in 2019-20. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector is estimated to grow by 2.8 percent in 2019-20 as compared to growth of 2.9 percent in 2018-19. According to the 2010-11 Agricultural Census, 47% of landholdings had become less than half a hectare in size. These holdings are too small to support a family of five so that many farmers now seek alternative sources of income – NITI 3-year action agenda About 80 percent of farmers own less than two hectare. SALIENT FEATURES OF AN INDIAN AGRICULTURE Subsistence type of agriculture. Dependent on unreliable and erratic monsoon (about 60 percent ) India’s vast relief, varying climate and soil conditions produce a variety of crops All tropical, subtropical and temperate crops are grown across geographical areas. Predominance of food crop → about 2/3rd of total cropped area. Backbone of rural economy. Plays critical role in ensuring food security Poor electricity, storage, water, credit & marketing infrastructure. Supports allied sectors and activities – cattle, poultry etc. Major involvement of women in Indian agriculture sector Characterized by po or mechanization, inadequate Agricultural research and extension services. Fragmented nature of agricultural holding. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course PRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURE Productivity of Agriculture is defined as the number of crops produced per unit land. Productivity levels in Indian agriculture are very low as compared to the productivity levels of other countries – China, USA etc. Like in 2018 , average productivity in India was 3075 Kg/ ha while world average was 3200kg/ha . Fertiliser use, irrigation and rainfall cause significant variation in productivity Productivity in the regions of Green revolution are certainly higher than other areas. Other high productivity regions are Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Maharashtra. The productivity in Gangetic plain is reducing because of Land bifurcation leading to reduced size of land holdings. Key issues affecting agricultural productivity include the decreasing sizes of agricultural land holdings, continued dependence on the monsoon , inadequate access to irrigation , imbalanced use of soil nutrients resulting in loss of fertility of soil, uneven access to modern technology in different parts of the country, lack of access to formal agricultural credit , limited procurement of food grains by government agencies, and failure to provide remunerative prices to farmers. Cropping Intensity The ratio of the gross cropped area to the net sown area. As the land is cropped multiple times, the cropping intensity increases. It depends on factors like climate, demand of crops, availability of irrigation and other inputs etc. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Boosting productivity Boosting productivity in agriculture in a sustainable manner requires us to work on four fronts: Irrigation The main reason for low crop intensity is access to water and moisture for crop production in Rabi season. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) provides a sound framework for the expansion as well as effective use of water in irrigation. Seeds and Fertilizer We need to enhance seed-research capacity as well as multiply stations so that seed replacement rate should be increased. Soil health cards need to be promoted as they are important for customizing fertilizer use. New Technology Genetically modified (GM) seeds have emerged as a powerful new technology promising high productivity, improved quality and lower use of fertilizers, weedicides and pesticides in the last one to two decades. Precision farming and related new technologies allow highly efficient farming and resource conservation. Diversification Crop diversification provides the farmers with a wider choice in the production of a variety of crops in a given area so as to expand production related activities on various crops and also to bring down the possible risk CROPS A crop is a plant or animal product that can be grown and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence. Basic facts India produced 284.83 Mn tons of food grains in 2018. India is the world’s largest producer of milk, pulses and jute. India occupies a leading position in global trade of agricultural products, agricultural export basket accounts for a little over 2.15 per cent of the world agricultural trade. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Crop classification based upon the type of produce Type Description Examples Food crops Crops used for human consumption Cereals, i.e. grass like plants with starchy edible seeds having high nutritional value – rice, wheat, maize. Pulses for e.g. gram tur etc. Cash crop Grown for sale in raw or processed form Cotton, jute, tobacco, castor, oilseeds Plantation crop Grown in plantations covering large estates. Tea, coffee, coconut, rubber, spices, etc. Horticulture Fruits and vegetables Fruits (apple, mango, bananas) and vegetables (onion, tomato etc.) Crop classification based upon climate Tropical Temperate Crops grown well in hot and warm climate Crops grown well in cool climate e.g. rice, sugarcane, jawar e.g. wheat, gram, potato Crop classification based on growing season The kharif Season starts in June and ends in October and largely coincides with Southwest Monsoon under which the cultivation of tropical crops such as rice, cotton, jute, jowar, bajra and tur is possible. The rabi Season begins with the onset of winter in October-November and ends in March-April. The low temperature conditions during this season facilitate the cultivation of temperate and subtropical crops such as wheat, gram and mustard. Zaid Short duration summer cropping season beginning after harvesting of rabi crops. The cultivation of watermelons, cucumbers, vegetables and fodder crops during this season is done on irrigated lands. However, this type of distinction in the cropping season does not exist in southern parts of the country. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course FOOD GRAINS Food grains are dominant crops in all parts of the country whether they have subsistence or commercial agricultural economy. Food grains Cereals Pulses Cereals The cereals occupy about 54 per cent of the total cropped area in India. India produces a variety of cereals, which are classified as fine grains (rice, wheat) and coarse grains (jowar, bajra, maize, ragi), etc. Pulses Pulses are a very important ingredient of vegetarian food as these are rich sources of proteins . These are legume crops which increase the natural fertility of soils through nitrogen fixation . India is a leading producer of pulses and accounts for about one-fifth of the total production of pulses in the world. The cultivation of pulses in the country is largely concentrated in the drylands of Deccan and central plateaus and north-western parts of the country. Pulses occupy about 11 per cent of the total cropped area in the country. Being the rainfed crops of drylands, the yields of pulses are low and fluctuate from year to year . Gram and tur are the main pulses cultivated in India. In India, the dryland farming is largely confined to the regions having annual rainfall less than 75 cm . These regions grow hardy and drought resistant crops such as ragi, bajra, moong, gram and fodder crops. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes MAJOR FOOD CROPS IN INDIA RICE Rice is preferred staple food in southern and north-eastern India. India produced 42 mmt in 2018-19, 2 nd highest production in world after China. India had the highest export volume of rice worldwide, at 9.8 million metric tons as of 2018/2019. West Bengal is the largest producer followed by Uttar Pradesh. Favourable conditions ● Rice is tropical and kharif crop (warm and wet climate is ideal) ● Temperature: Between 22-32°C with high humidity. ● Annual Rainfall: above 150 cm ● Requires semi aquatic conditions ● Soil Type: Deep clayey and loamy soil Geo. Distribution ● Rice is a staple food for the overwhelming majority of the population in India. ● About one-fourth of the total cropped area in the country is under rice cultivation. ● Though it is considered to be a crop of tropical humid areas, it has about 3,000 varieties which are grown in different agro-climatic regions. ● These are successfully grown from sea level to about 2,000 m altitude and from humid areas in eastern India to dry but irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, western U.P. and northern Rajasthan . ● In southern states and West Bengal , the climatic conditions allow the cultivation of two or three crops of rice in an agricultural year . ● In the Himalayas and north-western parts of the country, it is grown as a kharif crop during the southwest Monsoon season. Other information In West Bengal farmers grow three crops of rice called ‘aus’, ‘aman’ and ‘boro’. Farmers in West Bengal are experimenting with the Pokkali variety of rice to tide over a crisis-like situation created by severe seawater incursion into paddy fields in the Sundarbans (owing to Cyclone Amphan ). Vyttila-11 varieties of pokkali seedlings were brought from Kerala. The pokkali variety of rice is known for its saltwater resistance and flourishes in the rice paddies of coastal Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts of Kerala. Kuttanad Below Sea Level Farming System of Keral a is Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) site in India. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching WHEAT Wheat is preferred staple food in northern and north-western parts of India. India’s wheat production has increased to a record 20 million tonne (MT) for the crop year 2018-19 (July-June ), up by 1.3% from a year ago. India is the third largest producer of wheat after EU and China. Largest producer of wheat in India is Uttar Pradesh followed by Punjab and Haryana. Favourable conditions ● Temperature: Between 10-15°C (Sowing time) and 21-26°C (Ripening & Harvesting) with bright sunlight. ● Wheat is a temperate crop which requires a cool climate with moderate rainfall. ● It shows great adaptability & can be grown in tropics as well (yields are low in tropics). ● Wheat is rabi crop (Winter crop) ● Rainfall: Around 75-100 cm. ● Soil Type: Well-drained fertile loamy and clayey loamy (Ganga-Sutlej plains and black soil region of the Deccan) ● Light drizzles and cloudiness (E.g. Weather brought by Western Disturbances) at the time of ripening help in increasing the yield. Geo. Distribution ● Wheat is the second most important cereal crop in India after rice. ● India produces about 12 percent of the world’s total wheat production. ● It is primarily a crop of temperate zones. Hence, its cultivation in India is done during winter i.e. rabi season. ● About 85 percent of total area under this crop is concentrated in north and central regions of the country i.e. Indo-Gangetic Plain, Malwa Plateau and Himalayas up to 2,700 m altitude. ▪ Being a rabi crop, it is mostly grown under irrigated conditions. ▪ But it is a rainfed crop in Himalayan highlands and parts of Malwa plateau in Madhya Pradesh. ▪ Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are five leading wheat producing states. Other information Rice-wheat cropping system is labour, water, capital and energy-intensive, and becomes less profitable as availability of these resources diminishes. The problem is further exacerbated by dynamics of climate change. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course MILLETS Temperature: Between 27-32°C Rainfall: Around 50-100 cm. Soil Type: Can be grown in inferior alluvial or loamy soil because they are less sensitive to soil deficiencies India is the largest producer followed by Niger . Entirely grown under subsistence farming Grown for fodder crops Very nutritious and affordable, important for Nutrition security but least preferred given low remunerative outcomes. Millets include jawar, bajara, ragi etc. 4. Jawar Jawar – 3th most important crop after rice and wheat Jowar has high nutritional value. Jowar is grown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons. It is sown in both kharif and rabi seasons in southern states. But it is a kharif crop in northern India where it is mostly grown as a fodder crop Suitable for rainfed areas of dryland farming. Require around 30 cm rainfall – dry situation The coarse cereals together occupy about 16.50 per cent of total cropped area in the country. Among these, jowar or sorghum alone accounts for about 5.3 per cent of total cropped area. It is the main food crop in semi-arid areas of central and southern India. Maharashtra alone produces more than half of the total jowar production of the country. Other leading producer states of jowar are Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Bajra is sown in hot and dry climatic conditions in north-western and western parts of the country. It is a hardy crop which resists frequent dry spells and drought in this region. It is cultivated alone as well as part of mixed cropping . This coarse cereal occupies about 5.2 per cent of the total cropped area in the country. Leading producers of bajra are the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana . Being a rainfed crop, the yield level of this crop is low in Rajasthan and fluctuates a lot from year to year. Yield of this crop has increased during recent years in Haryana and Gujarat due to introduction of drought resistant varieties and expansion of irrigation under it. 6. Maize Maize is rainfed kharif Maize is a food as well as fodder crop grown under semi-arid climatic conditions and over inferior soils. This crop occupies only about 3.6 per cent of total cropped area. India is the Sixth Largest producer of the crop in the world. Maize cultivation is not concentrated in any specific region . It is sown all over India except eastern and north-eastern regions. The leading producers of maize are the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Yield level of maize is higher than other coarse cereals. It is high in southern states and declines towards central parts. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching 7. OILSEEDS Favourable conditions ● Temperature: Between 15-30°C ● Rainfall: Around 30-75 cm. ● Soil Type: Loam to clayey loam and well drained sandy loams. ● The oilseeds are produced for extracting edible oils. ● Groundnut, rapeseed and mustard, soybean and sunflower are the main oilseed crops grown in India.

But in southern India, it is cultivated during rabi season as well. It is a tropical crop that requires 50-75 cm of rainfall. It covers about 3.6 per cent of the total cropped area in the country. Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are the leading producers. Yield of groundnut is comparatively high in Tamil Nadu where it is partly irrigated. But its yield is low in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Rapeseed and Mustard Rapeseed and mustard comprise several oilseeds as rai, sarson, toria and taramira. These are subtropical crops cultivated during rabi season in north-western and central parts of India. These are frost sensitive crops and their yields fluctuate from year to year. But with the expansion of irrigation and improvement in seed technology, their yields have improved and stabilised to some extent. About two-third of the cultivated area under these crops is irrigated. These oilseeds together occupy only 2.5 per cent of the total cropped area in the country. Rajasthan contributes about one-third production while other leading producers are Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. Yields of these crops are comparatively high in Haryana and Rajasthan. Soyabean Soyabean is mostly grown in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. These two states together produce about 90 per cent of total output of soyabean in the country. Sunflower Sunflower cultivation is concentrated in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and adjoining areas of Maharashtra. It is a minor crop in northern parts of the country where its yield is high due to Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Sesamum India accounts for one-third of the world production and is the largest producer. Since it is a rainfed kharif crop the production fluctuates greatly with time. Sesamum is produced in almost all parts of the country. West Bengal is the largest producing state (one-third of the total production of India). The other major producers are Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, etc. CASH CROPS Cash crops are crops that are grown for sale in the market. E.g. Cotton, jute, tobacco, castor, oilseeds, sugarcane etc. They occupy only about 15 percent of cropped area but account for over 40 percent of agriculture production by value. Cotton Cotton is chiefly a tropical and sub-tropical crop. Temperature: Between 21-30°C Rainfall: Around 50-100 cm Soil Type: Well drained deep black soils (regur-lava soil) of the Deccan Plateau, Malwa Plateau and those of Gujarat are best suited for cotton cultivation. It is a tropical and subtropical crop grown in the kharif season in semi-arid areas of the country. India grows both short staple (Indian) cotton as well as long staple (American) cotton called ‘ Narma’ in north-western parts of the country Cotton occupies about 4.7 per cent of the total cropped area in the country. India is the Largest producer of cotton. (2018-19) Almost 65 per cent of the area under cotton is rainfed with erratic and poorly distributed rains. It is also subjected to severe attack of pests and diseases. There are three cotton growing areas , i.e. parts of Punjab, Haryana and northern Rajasthan in north-west, Gujarat and Maharashtra in the west and plateaus of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Largest producer is Gujarat followed by Maharashtra . (2018-19) Labor – Since picking of cotton is not yet mechanized, a lot of cheap and efficient labour is required. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching TYPES OF COTTON Long staple cotton It has the longest fibre whose length varies from 24 to 27 mm . The fibre is fine and lustrous and is used for making superior quality cloth. About half of the total cotton produced in India is long staple. It is largely grown in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. Medium staple cotton The length of its fiber is between 20 mm and 24 mm . About 44 per cent of the total cotton production in India is of medium staple. Rajasthan, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are its main producers. Short staple cotton This is inferior cotton with fibre less than 20 mm long. It is used for manufacturing inferior cloth and fetches less price. About 6 per cent of the total production is of short staple cotton. U.P, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab are its main producers. BT COTTON à Bt stands for the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Bacillus thuringiensis produces a toxin called bt. toxin which is detrimental for certain kind of pest (bollworms) that infects cotton crop. This trait of Bacillus thuringiensis is induced into cotton by genetic modification. The Bt cotton was first tested in U.S.A. and it to cultivation there in 1995. China (1997) and India (2002) also followed the cultivation of Bt cotton. Jute Jute is the second most important fiber crop in India after cotton. Humid climate (120-150 cm) with 80-90 percent relative humidity during the period of its growth. It is a cash crop in West Bengal and adjoining eastern parts of the country. India lost large jute growing areas to East Pakistan (Bangladesh) during partition. At present, India produces about three-fifth of jute production of the world. West Bengal accounts for about three-fourth of the production in the country. Bihar and Assam are other jute growing areas. Just like cotton, jute also exhausts the fertility of soil rapidly. It is necessary that the soil is replenished annually by the silt-laden flood water of the rivers. Large supply of cheap labor and lot of water are necessary for processing the jute fiber post-harvest. Over 99 per cent of the total jute of India is produced in just five states of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Being concentrated only in a few states, this crop accounts for only about 0.5 per cent of the total cropped area in the country. Jute is used for making coarse cloth, bags, sacks and decorative items. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Sugarcane Temperature : Between 21-27°C with hot and humid climate. Rainfall : Around 75-100 cm. Soil Type: Deep rich loamy soil. Sugarcane is a crop of tropical areas . Under rainfed conditions, it is cultivated in sub-humid and humid climates . But it is largely an irrigated crop in India. India became the largest sugarcane producer in 2018-19, beats brazil for first time in 16 years. In the Indo-Gangetic plain, its cultivation is largely concentrated in Uttar Pradesh . Sugarcane growing area in western India is spread over Maharashtra and Gujarat . Why is the sugar industry shifting from northern to peninsular India? The tropical climate of Peninsular India results in higher yield per unit hectare of land. Higher sucrose content in peninsular cane as here grows tropical varieties of Sugarcane. Tropical sugarcane areas are the northern plains. Sub-tropical variety has low sugar content. Sugar factories shut in winter. From northern plains the factories shifted to Punjab, Haryana, South India and Western India. Long crushing season in the south. Cooperative sugar mills are more successful in management in south India. PLANTATION CROP A plantation is a large-scale estate meant for farming that specializes in cash crops. The crops that are grown include cotton, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar cane, sisal, oil seeds, oil palms, fruits, rubber trees and forest trees.

Geo. Distribution ● In India, tea plantations started in the 1840s in Brahmaputra valley of Assam which still is a major tea growing area in the country. ● Later on, its plantation was introduced in the sub-Himalayan region of West Bengal (Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Bihar districts) ● Tea is also cultivated on the lower slopes of Nilgiris and Cardamom hills in Western Ghats. Other information ● Tea requires an abundant supply of cheap and skilled labour at every stage. ● It is one of the largest employers of women among the organized industries of India. ● India is the second largest producer of tea in the world (2019), producing an average 1,325,050 tonnes each year. ● Assam is the largest producer among Indian states. ● India is the fourth largest exporter after China, Sri Lanka and Kenya. ● 14% of global tea exports and nearly 20% of the tea produced in the country is exported, according to Tea Board India. ● Declining export because : India’s Assam CTC Tea faces competition from Kenya while orthodox tea faces competition from Sri Lanka & Mozambique. · Issues with the Industry – The lack of innovation in tea plant and the agricultural practices (e.g. slower pace of replantation) accompanying it has stagnated the leaf quality and output – Rising input prices , is making tree farming less profitable. – Large share of tea production comes from small, independent farmers , will find tea production unsustainable. – Monsoon Dependence. – Various tariff and non-tariff barriers by many importing countries. For example Phyto-sanitary related objection raised by the EU, is hampering exports. – Trade Policy related : The FTP 2015, which reduced exports concessions to tea from 5% to 3%. – The tea farms in India are often hit by strikes and labour unrest. – Many areas known for tea gardens, like Assam and the Darjeeling hills, suffer from insurgency, social unrest and extortion . This scares away fresh investment and fresh capital. It is indigenous to Abyssinia Plateau (Ethiopia). Coffee was first raised in the Baba Budan Hills of Karnataka. British planters established large coffee estates in 1820s near Chikmagalur (Karnataka), Wayanad, Shevoroys and Nilgiris in TN.

Karnataka alone accounts for more than two-third of total production of coffee in the country Other information ● There are three varieties of coffee i.e. Arabica , Robusta and Liberia . India mostly grows superior quality coffee, Arabica, which is in great demand in the International market. ● Coffee cultivation requires plenty of cheap and skilled labor. ● Northern and eastern aspects of slopes are preferred as they are less exposed to strong afternoon sun and the south-west monsoon winds. ● Karnataka produces more than 70% of Coffee followed by Kerala. ● Almost the entire production is shared by three states namely Karnataka (71%), Kerala (22%) and Tamil Nadu (6.5%). In wetland farming , the rainfall is in excess of soil moisture requirement of plants during the rainy season. Such regions may face flood and soil erosion hazards. These areas grow various water intensive crops such as rice, jute and sugarcane and practice aquaculture in the freshwater bodies. Rubber Rubber is obtained from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis and many other tropical trees. It begins to yield latex in 5-7 years after planting. Hevea brasiliensis requires hot (25°-35°C) and humid climate (200 cm). The rainfall should be well distributed throughout the year. Deep well drained loamy soils are best suited for rubber plantations. Almost entire rubber is produced in Kerala (92%), Tamil Nadu (3%) and Karnataka (2%) and Tripura (2%) is the fourth largest producer. Andaman & Nicobar Islands also produce small quantities of rubber. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course SPICES Pepper, cardamom, chillies, turmeric, ginger are some of the important spices produced in India. They are used for flavoring foodstuffs .

HORTICULTURE India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world after China. Horticulture sector contributes about 25-30 per cent of GDP from agriculture. India is the largest producer of bananas and mangoes . Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Cashew Nut ● Cashew kernel is used as a dry fruit. ● India holds first position in the world in the production of cashew. ● Coasts of Maharashtra (29.9%), Andhra Pradesh (15.7%), Odisha, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are the major producers. Mango ● Mango is the native to the Indian monsoon lands. ● More than half of the world’s mangoes are produced in India. It is also the largest exporter. ● Alfonso mango is an important export variety. ● Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, West ● Bengal, Odisha, are the main producers. Apple ● Apple is a temperate fruit crop . ● It requires sunny climate with gentle winds. ● Partial sun reduces yields. ● It requires average temperature (~22°C) during the growing season. In the non-growing season, apple crop can tolerate very low temperatures. ● Low temperature, rain, fog and cloudy weather hampers growth at the time of maturity. ● Well distributed 100-125 cm rainfall throughout the growing season is optimal. Apple orchard regions should be free from hail storms and frost. ● Kullu and Shimla districts in Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir Valley and hilly areas of Uttarakhand are important apple growing areas. Banana ● Banana is a tropical and sub-tropical crop. ● Although cultivation is spread all over India. But peninsular India provides ideal conditions for its cultivation. ● Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra account for about half of total production. Orange ● Most of orange orchards are rainfed . ● Although orange is grown in almost all states, its cultivation is more prominently concentrated in the hilly region of Uttarakhand. ● Kangra valley of Himachal Pradesh, Darjeeling in W. Bengal, Khasi and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, Kodagu district of Karnataka are the important orange growing regions. Peach ● Peach is temperate fruit that is highly perishable (more than apple). CROP DIVERSIFICATION It refers to a shift from the regional dominance of one crop to production of a number of crops. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Why is it Needed? Maintaining soil fertility: Only those crops are grown in a particular region which are suitable to a particular agro climate zone and it helps in maintaining soil fertility because excessive use of nutrients, irrigation is not required. To arrest depletion of groundwater : It will help in diversifying cropping patterns from water guzzling crops such as paddy to pulses, oilseeds, maize with the aim of tackling the problem of depleting water tables. Diversification can also provide habitat for beneficial insects and at the same time reduce colonization by pests. Additional employment opportunities Reducing risk from agriculture sector Insurance against vagaries of nature, pests etc. Higher level of income – reduction in poverty (SDG-1) MEANING AND REASONS FOR DIVERSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES It means reducing the share of labour force in agriculture sector and finding employment in Non- farm activities Reasons To Reduce Risk of Earning from Agriculture Sector To Give Wider Choice TYPES OF FARMING On the basis of main source of moisture for crops, the farming can be classified as- Main source of moisture Irrigated Rainfed Irrigated farming can be of two types – Protective Productive Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Type Description Protective The objective of protective irrigation is to protect the crops from adverse effects of soil moisture deficiency which often means that irrigation acts as a supplementary source of water over and above the rainfall. Productive Productive irrigation is meant to provide sufficient soil moisture in the cropping season to achieve high productivity Rainfed farming It is further classified on the basis of adequacy of soil moisture during cropping season into dryland and wetland farming Dryland farming In India, the dryland farming is largely confined to the regions having annual rainfall less than 75 cm. These regions grow hardy and drought resistant crops such as ragi, bajra, moong, gram and guar (fodder crops) and practice various measures of soil moisture conservation and rainwater harvesting. Wetland farming The rainfall is in excess of soil moisture requirement of plants during the rainy season. Such regions may face flood and soil erosion hazards. These areas grow various water intensive crops such as rice, jute and sugarcane and practice aquaculture in the freshwater bodies. CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE According to the World bank , Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an integrated approach to managing landscapes – cropland, livestock, forests and fisheries – that address the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change. Climate Smart Agriculture also known as Climate Resilient Agriculture. It is the development of agriculture under new realities of climate change. “Agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience (adaptation), reduces/removes GHGs (mitigation) where possible, and enhances achievement of national food security and development goals” – FAO Climate-smart agriculture helps in the following ways: Triple win-increase yield Make yield resilient Make farm a solution to climate changes problem Reduction and removal of GHGs Would help in achieving SDGs and food security. Adapt and build resilience to climate change Reduce and/or remove greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Practices under Climate smart Agriculture: Minimum soil disturbance Zero tillage is ideal , but the system may involve controlled tillage in which no more than 20 to 25% of the soil surface is disturbed. Retention of crop residues or other soil surface cover Use of crop rotations – Crop rotation helps reduce build-up of weeds, pests and diseases. Where farmers do not have enough land to rotate crops , intercropping can be used. Legumes are recommended as rotational crops for their nitrogen-fixing functions.

It is also called an Integrated Biosystem . Crop Farming Livestock The Integrated Farming system has revolutionized conventional farming of livestock, aquaculture, horticulture, agro-industry and allied activities. It is a combined approach aimed at efficient sustainable resource management for increased productivity in the cropping system. The IFS approach has multiple objectives of sustainability, food security, farmer’s security and poverty reduction by involving livestock, vermicomposting, organic farming etc. IFS provides multiple benefits that are sustainable and can pave the way for climate-smart agriculture . India needs to adopt a “well designed” Integrated Farming System (IFS) to realize the vision of doubling farmers’ income by 2022 (Ashok Dalwai Committee) and having sustainable agricultural practices Integrated Farming Climate change and air quality Organization and Planning Crop health and protection Crop Nutrition Human and Social Capital Waste Management and pollution control Landscape and Nature conservation Animal husbandry and animal welfare Energy Efficiency Water Use and Protection Soil Management IRRIGATION Irrigation is described as the artificial application of water to the land or soil . It is the substitute or supplement of rainwater with another source of water. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course IRRIGATION Tanks Drip irrigation River Lift Systems Wells Canals Well and Tube Well Irrigation: Wells are mainly found in P., Bihar, Tamil Nadu, etc. There are various types of wells – shallow wells, deep wells, tube wells, artesian wells, etc. From the shallow wells water is not always available as the level of water goes down during the dry months. Deep wells are more suitable for the purpose of irrigation as water from them is available throughout the year. At places where groundwater is available, a tube well can be installed near the agricultural area. A deep tube well worked by electricity, can irrigate a much larger area than a surface well. Tube wells are mostly used in P., Haryana, Punjab, Bihar and Gujarat. Merits Demerits Well is the simplest, cheapest and independent source of irrigation and can be used as and when the necessity arises. Only a limited area can be irrigated. In the event of a drought, the ground water level falls and enough water is not available. Several chemicals such as nitrate, chloride, sulphate, etc. found in well water add to the fertility of soil. Tube wells can draw a lot of groundwater from its neighboring areas and make the ground dry and unfit for agriculture. More reliable during periods of drought when surface water dries up. Wastage of water due to subsidized electricity in green revolution region Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Canal Irrigation: Canals can be an effective source of irrigation in areas of low-level relief, deep fertile soils, perennial source of water and extensive command area. Therefore, the main concentration of canal irrigation is in the northern plain of India, especially the areas comprising Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. The digging of canals in rocky and uneven areas is difficult and uneconomic. Thus, canals are practically absent from the Peninsular plateau area. However, the coastal and the delta regions in South India do have some canals for irrigation. Merits Demerits Most of the canals provide perennial irrigation and supply water as and when needed. Many canals overflow during the rainy season and flood the surrounding areas. This saves the crops from drought conditions and helps in increasing the farm production. Canal irrigation is suitable in plain areas only. This sediment is deposited in the agricultural fields which make soil more fertile. The canal water soaks into the ground and results in water-logging along the canal route. Initial cost involved in canal irrigation is more, it is quite cheap in the long run. Excessive flow of water in the fields raises the ground water level. Capillary action brings alkaline salts to the surface and makes large areas unfit for agriculture Two types: Inundation canals, which are taken out from the rivers without any regulating system like weirs etc. at their head. Such canals provide irrigation mainly in the rainy season when the river is in flood and there is excess water. Perennial Canals are those which are taken off from perennial rivers by constructing a barrage across the river. Most of the canals in India are perennial. Tanks Irrigation: A tank is developed by constructing a small bund of earth or stones built across a stream. The water impounded by the bund is used for irrigation and other purposes. Tank comprises an important source of irrigation in the Karnataka Plateau, MP, Maharashtra, Odisha, Kerala Bundelkhand area of MP, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Merits Demerits Most of the tanks are natural and do not involve heavy cost for their construction Many tanks dry up during the dry season and fail to provide irrigation when it is required. Tanks have a longer life span. Much water is evaporated from the large expanse of shallow water and is therefore not available for irrigation. In many tanks, fishing is also carried on, which supplements both the food resources and income of the farmer Lifting of water from tanks and carrying it to the fields is a strenuous and costly exercise. Drip irrigation: In drip irrigation, water is applied near the plant root through emitters or drippers, on or below the soil surface, at a low rate varying from 2-20 liters per hour. The soil moisture is kept at an optimum level with frequent irrigations. Among all irrigation methods, drip irrigation is the most efficient and can be practiced for a large variety of crops, especially in vegetables, orchard crops, flowers and plantation crops. Merits Demerits Fertilizer and nutrient loss is minimized due to localized application and reduced leaching. Initial cost can be more. Field leveling is not necessary. Recycled non-potable water can be used. Can result in clogging, wastage of water, time and harvest, if not installed properly. Water application efficiency increases. Lack of skilled labor. Soil erosion and weed growth is lessened. Maintenance is costly Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Sprinkler Irrigation: In this method, water is sprayed into the air and allowed to fall on the ground surface somewhat resembling rainfall. The spray is developed by the flow of water under pressure through small orifices or nozzles. The sprinkler irrigation system is a very suitable method for irrigation on uneven lands and on shallow soils. Nearly all crops are suitable for sprinkler irrigation systems except crops like paddy, jute, etc. The dry crops, vegetables, flowering crops, orchards, plantation crops like tea, coffee are all suitable and can be irrigated through sprinklers. Merits Demerits Suitable to all types of soil except heavy clay Lack of skilled labor to manage it Water saving to 30% – 50 % Higher initial cost. Increase in yield Under high wind conditions and high temperature distribution and application efficiency is poor. Saves land as no bunds etc. are required. Reduces productivity of soil in long term Fertigation Fertigation is a method of fertilizer application in which fertilizer is incorporated within the irrigation water by the drip system. In this system fertilizer solution is distributed evenly in irrigation . The availability of nutrients is very high therefore the efficiency is more. In this method liquid fertilizer as well as water soluble fertilizers are used . By this method, fertilizer use efficiency is increased from 80 to 90 per cent. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Advantages of fertigation Nutrients and water are supplied near the active root zone through fertigation which results in greater absorption by the crops. As water and fertilizer are supplied evenly to all the crops through fertigation there is possibility for getting 25-50 per cent higher yield. Fertilizer use efficiency through fertigation ranges between 80-90 per cent, which helps to save a minimum of 25 per cent of nutrients. By this way, along with less amount of water and saving of fertilizer, time, labour and energy use is also reduced substantially. PRADHAN MANTRI KRISHI SINCHAI YOJANA (PMKSY) PMKSY envisages amalgamation of – Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR RD & GR) Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) of Department of Land Resources (DoLR) On Farm Water Management (OFWM) of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) Objectives: Achieve convergence of investments in irrigation at the field level Har Khet ko pani – Expand cultivable area under assured irrigation More crop per drop – Improve on-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage of water & enhance the adoption of precision-irrigation and other water saving technologies Enhance recharge of aquifers and introduce sustainable water conservation practices by exploring the feasibility of reusing treated municipal based water for peri-urban agriculture Attract greater private investment in precision irrigation systems. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Salient features Decentralized State level planning and projectized execution’ structure, in order to allow States to draw up a District Irrigation Plan (DIP) and a State Irrigation Plan (SIP ). These plans need to be prepared in order to access PMKSY fund. It will be supervised and monitored by Inter-Ministerial National Steering Committee (NSC) under PM with Union Ministers of all concerned Ministries. A National Executive Committee (NEC) is to be constituted under the Chairmanship of the Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog to oversee programme implementation. PMKSY has been formulated amalgamating ongoing schemes Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP); Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP); and On Farm Water Management (OFWM) component of National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). Water budgeting is done for all sectors namely, household, agriculture and industries. Investments will happen at farm level. So, farmers know what is happening and can provide valuable feedback. Recently , Long Term Irrigation Fund has been instituted under PMKSY in NABARD for funding and fast tracking the implementation of incomplete major and medium irrigation projects. NATIONAL WATERSHED PROJECT Watershed project involves conservation , regeneration and judicious use of all the resources like land, water, plants, animals and humans within the watershed area. The National Watershed Project also known as Neeranchal . National Watershed Project is a World Bank assisted watershed management project. The objective of this project is to support Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) through technical assistance to improve incremental conservation outcomes for the natural resources including water, soil and forests while enhancing agricultural yields in a sustainable manner for farming communities. Water-stressed regions of India such as Northwest India , Vidarbha region of Maharashtra etc. are prone to drought and water scarcity thus affecting the agricultural production in the regions. The National Watershed Project has the potential in increasing agricultural production in these regions. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course SOIL NUTRITION Nutrition provided to the soil plays an important role in soil fertility and productivity. It can be provided through Manure or fertilizer. However, fertilizer is more commonly used. Advantages: · In initial years the yields increased · Provided increased income to farmers especially in North Western states · Improvement in soil fertility. Disadvantages: · Macro nutrient imbalance in soil. · Degradation of soil. · Drain on the economic resources of the country due to huge urea subsidies, next only to oil and food subsidies. · Fertilizers entering the food chain impacting ecology and human health. · Stagnant or reducing yields in the last few years. Future solutions: · Holistic approach to improve farming using environment friendly methods · Technology like drip irrigation, balanced use of fertilizers, good quality seeds, storage and transport infrastructure. · Agroforestry, food processing to increase farmer income so that pressure on increasing yields is reduced. · Analysis of existing situation in country, soil, climate and crops to come up with new scientific ratio of NPK in fertilizers. SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES OF SOIL NUTRITION Organic farming: Organic farming can be defined as an agricultural process that uses biological fertilizers and pest control acquired from animal or plant waste. Advantages of Organic Farming: Economical – In organic farming no expensive fertilizers, pesticides, HYV seeds are required for the plantation of crops. Therefore, no extra expense. Good return on Investment – With the usage of cheaper and local inputs, a farmer can make a good return on investment. High Demand – There is a huge demand for the organic product in India and across the globe, generating more income through export. Nutritional – As compared to chemical and fertilizer utilized products, organic products are more nutritional, tasty, and good for health. Environment-Friendly – The farming of organic products is free of chemicals and fertilizers, so it doesn’t harm the environment. Disadvantages: Incompetent – The major issue of organic farming is the lack of Inadequate infrastructure and marketing of the product. Less production – The organic farming products are lesser in the initial years as compared to the chemical product. So, the farmers find it difficult to accommodate large scale production. Shorter shelf-life – Organic products have more flaws and shorter shelf life than the chemical product.( organic fruits and vegetables aren’t treated with waxes or preservatives, they may spoil faster.) Limited production – Off-season crops are limited and have fewer choices in organic farming. As the yield productivity is less in organic farming the cost of food is very high. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana: To promote natural resource based integrated and climate resilient sustainable farming To reduce the cost of agriculture to farmers through sustainable integrated organic farming systems thereby enhancing farmer’s net income per unit of land. To protect the environment from hazardous inorganic chemicals by adoption of eco-friendly low-cost traditional techniques and farmer friendly technologies. To empower farmers through their own institutional development in the form of clusters and groups with capacity to manage production, processing, value addition and certification management. To make farmers entrepreneurs through direct market linkages with local and national markets Zero budget natural Farming (ZBNF): Zero budget natural farming is a method of chemical-free agriculture drawing from traditional Indian practices. It was originally promoted by agriculturist Subhash Palekar , who developed it in the mid-1990s as an alternative to the Green Revolution’s methods that are driven by chemical fertilizers and pesticides and intensive irrigation. Andhra Pradesh has pledged to switch to ZBNF by 2024 and govt’s support. ZBNF is based on 4 pillars: Jeevamrutha :- It is a mixture of fresh cow dung and aged cow urine (both from India’s indigenous cow breed), jaggery, pulse flour, water and soil; to be applied on farmland Bijamrita :- It is a concoction of neem leaves & pulp, tobacco and green chilies prepared for insect and pest management, that can be used to treat seeds. Acchadana (Mulching) :- It protects topsoil during cultivation and does not destroy it Whapasa :- It is the condition where there are both air molecules and water molecules present in the soil. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching SEEDS: PRESENT SCENARIO AND MEASURES Among the various inputs required for crop production, Seed is the most basic and vital one , hence timely availability of good quality seeds is the deciding factor in the growth of the agriculture sector in India. Issues involved in acquiring quality seeds: The high cost of hybrid as well as genetically modified seeds especially with respect to the seeds of commercial crops. Introduction of some spurious seeds by some private companies in the market. High fertilizer and irrigation requirement of hybrid seeds. Requirement of a special environment by genetically modified seeds to germinate. Due to the huge demand supply gap, India suffers from a dismal seed Replacement Ratio. Seed replacement Ratio (SRR): Seed Replacement Rate (SSR) or Seed Replacement Ratio is a measure of how much of the total cropped area was sown with certified seeds in comparison to farm saved seeds Government Measures under Seed mission: To ensure easy availability of high-quality certified seeds at reasonable prices to farmers, the agriculture ministry has launched the National Mission on Seeds for the 12th Plan Period. To increase production of certified quality seeds To enhance the seed replacement rate (SRR). To upgrade quality of farm saved seeds To establish a seed reserve at regional levels to meet requirement during natural calamities Up-gradation of public sector seed producing agencies What needs to be done? The government should prepare and monitor seed production and formulate a supply plan for meeting the requirement of seeds according to the season. With the help of proper extension service government can make farmers aware of the value of SRR in the productivity of crops especially in case of pulses. The government should increase its contribution in production as well in distribution of good quality seeds to the farmers as compared to the contribution of private seed companies, so that the farmers are ensured of getting good quality seeds at a reasonable price. The government should make such policies that allow regular check on black marketing of seeds. The government should promote the concept of “Zero Budget Natural Farming” in which quality seeds are developed by farmers themselves.

Swaminathan brought HYV developed by Norman Borlaug Objective of Green Revolution: Manage food crisis Develop self-sufficiency in food production Modernization of agriculture Develop agro-industry interface Components of Green Revolution High Yielding Varieties (HYV) Use of Chemical Fertilizers and Pesticides Mechanization of Agriculture Irrigation Impact of Green Revolution POSITIVES The Green Revolution has remarkably increased Agricultural Production . The biggest beneficiary of the revolution was the Wheat Grain . Green Revolution increased the per hectare yield in case of wheat from 850 kg per hectare to an incredible 2281 kg/hectare in its early stage. India reached its way to self-sufficiency and was less dependent on imports. The production in the country was sufficient to meet the normal and emergency demand. Rather than depending on the import of food grains from other countries India started exporting its agricultural produce. There was a rise in rural employment . The tertiary industries created employment opportunities for the workforce. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Table 2. Average Yield Per Hectare of Crops during 1950-51 to 1999-2000 (Yield per hectare in Kgs) Year Rice Wheat Pulses 1950-51 1960-61 1970-71 1980-81 1990-91 1992-93 1995-96 1999-2000 668 1.013 1.123 1.336 1.740 1.744 1.855 1.986 663 851 1.307 1.630 2.281 2.327 2.493 2.778 441 539 524 433 578 573 552 635 The adoption of new technology has also given a boost to agricultural employment because of diverse job opportunities created by multiple cropping and shifts towards hired workers – transportation, irrigation, food processing, marketing. etc There has been more consistency with the annual harvest because the fields are worked in a similar way each year. New technology and modernization of agriculture have strengthened the linkages between agriculture and industry. It has helped to create numerous strains of plants that are resistant to disease and pests. It makes farmers more secure financially. The Green Revolution in India majorly benefited the farmers of the country. Farmers not only survived but also prospered during the revolution. Their income saw a significant raise which enabled them to shift from sustenance farming to commercial farming. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching NEGATIVE Retardation of agricultural growth due to inadequate irrigation cover, fragmentation of farm size, failure to evolve new technologies, inadequate use of technology, declining plan outlay, unbalanced use of inputs and weaknesses in credit delivery system. Regional dispersal of the evolution created regional inequalities . The benefits of the green revolution remained concentrated in the areas where the new technology was used. Since the revolution for the number of years remained limited to wheat production , its benefits were mostly accrued only to wheat-growing areas. Interpersonal inequalities between large and small scale farmers. Adverse effects on the distribution of pattern of income in rural areas. It led to widening the inter-regional and intra-regional disparities in income The new technologies introduced during the revolution called for substantial investments which were beyond the means of a majority of small farmers. Farmers having large farmlands continued to make greater absolute gains in income by reinvesting the earnings in farm and non-farm assets, purchasing land from the smaller cultivators, etc. Ecological cost of the green revolution is tremendous and unsustainable. The farmers are largely dependent on the market for the supply of inputs and for the demand for their products. Demand for agricultural credit has also increased as the new technology has increased the cash requirements of the farmers. Poor farmers were not able to get loans easily. There has been displacement of agricultural labour by extensive agricultural mechanization and left them unemployed. The hybrid crops have also created environmental impacts like soil pollution, water pollution due to excessive use of fertilisers, pesticides etc. needed by these crops. CONCLUSION There are both positive and negative impacts of the Green Revolution on farmers. Due to the Green Revolution there was a considerable increase in the food grains production which was extremely necessary for farmers to increase production so that agriculture became remunerative. Due to the Green Revolution, the agricultural sector of India is able to meet the increasing demand for food grains. However, now is the high time to bring a green revolution which is also farmers friendly. EVERGREEN REVOLUTION Evergreen revolution refers to productivity improvement in perpetuity without ecological and social harm. The evergreen revolution involves the integration of ecological principles in technology development and dissemination. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Need for Evergreen revolution : Need for the Evergreen revolution arose due to failures of the green revolution . More than five decades after India launched the Green Revolution, it has not only failed to eliminate hunger but also malnutrition is at its high. Wheat and rice have largely displaced more nutritious pulses and other cereals such as millets in consumption. Soil has lost its fertility due to unscientific application of fertilizers. Due to mechanization of agriculture, the likeliness for sons instead of daughters led to skewed sex ratio in Punjab, Haryana.(Perspective that men can handle machines better than women) Indian agriculture became cereal- centric and regionally biased. Water logging in fields and salinity increased due to excess irrigation. Farmers got burdened with debts from moneylenders, banks. Given growing population and over-exploitation of land resources , the pressure on food security will continue to rise. 65% of the population is still living in the villages and over 70% of the rural people are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. The Green Revolution was mainly confined to well irrigated areas . It was not successful in rain-fed areas, which contribute significantly to the country’s total food-grain production. The environmental consequences and ecological costs are offsetting the progress made so far. Depletion and pollution groundwater . The lakes and ponds are becoming less developed due to eutrophication – a direct consequence of the Green Revolution. Growth in the agricultural sector has been almost stagnant . GM crops are caught in various controversies related to intellectual property, ecological consequences, health consequences etc. Global warming is said to engulf productive coastal lands due to rise in sea levels. This creates an urgent need to raise agricultural productivity. It is necessary to develop a suitable strategy to improve agricultural development in India. To ensure equitable and sustainable growth Evergreen Revolution Should Ensure – Improving agricultural production Generating gainful self-employment for the small farmers and weaker sections of the society. Scaling up food production without disturbing the ecological balance . Boosting agricultural development, women empowerment (65-70% labourers in agriculture) and environmental protection. (Women are the major power in agriculture as about in crop production is contributed by women). Reclaiming degraded and low fertile lands and lands deprived of irrigation .

Ways To Make Second (Evergreen) Green Revolution A Success Story Precision Agriculture – farmers can make the most efficient use of vital inputs such as water and fertilizer by applying them in precise amounts. Testing labs – Testing of samples of soil from agricultural fields is vital for achieving nutrient stewardship. Technology – Mobile-based applications for farmers will form an important part of the data-driven precision agriculture approach. Efficient Use of Water Laser levelling – Laser levelling has been shown to improve crop yields, reduce labour time spent wedding, and, in particular, reduce water use for irrigation by up to 20-25 per cent. Developing additional water sources through tube wells, dug wells and farm ponds. Micro and drip irrigation Utilizing potential of fertigation technology Climate smart agriculture Promotion of Flood, Drought, and Salinity tolerant rice varieties. Use of Drum seeders for timely planting of direct seeded rice. Cultivation practices to increase biological and economic stability.

Enroll now for UPSC Online Course GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS (GM CROPS) According to WHO , GMOs or Genetically modified organisms are organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. Crops or foods using GM organisms are referred to as GM crops or Genetically modified crops. BT cotton , a non-food crop, has been the only GM crop cultivated in India yet attempts have been made to commercially release BT Brinjal and develop DMH -11 , a transgenic mustard. Issues and Challenges with GM Crops Monopoly à patent laws give developers of the GM crops a lot of control over the food supply e.g. the “terminator seeds” allows farmers to use the seeds just once. Outcrossing à the migration of genes from GM plants into conventional crops or wild species may have an indirect effect on food safety and food security. Decline in yield à after a few years with respect to many GM crops which in turn leads to diminishing returns. Environment concerns à like the susceptibility of non-target organisms (e.g. bees and butterflies), the loss of biodiversity of crop/plant species, presence of toxins (produced in GM crops) in every part of the plant may reach the soil/water table. Resistance developed by pathogens à to the toxins produced by GM crops. E.g. the pink bollworm has grown resistant to the toxins produced by BT cotton seed of Monsanto AGRICULTURE FINANCE This can be divided into two categories: Non-institutional sources Institutional sources ● Moneylenders ● Relatives ● Traders ● Commission agents ● Landlords ● Cooperative ● Scheduled Commercial Banks ● Regional Rural Banks Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Issues of Agriculture finance in India: Insufficiency à In spite of the expansion of rural credit structure, the volume of rural credit in the country is still insufficient as compared to its growing requirement arising out of the increase in prices of agricultural inputs. Inadequate amount of sanction à The amount of loan sanctioned to the farmers by the agencies is also very much inadequate for meeting their different aspects of agricultural operations. Considering the amount of loan sanctioned as inadequate and insignificant, the farmers often divert such loan for unproductive purposes and thereby dilute the very purpose of such loan. Lesser attention of poor farmers à Rural credit agencies and its schemes have failed to meet the needs of the small and marginal farmers. Thus, lesser attention has been given on the credit needs of the needy farmers whereas the comparatively well-to-do farmers are getting more attention from the credit agencies for their better creditworthiness. Inadequate institutional coverage à In India, the institutional credit arrangement continues to be inadequate as compared to its growing needs. The development of co-operative credit institutions like Primary agricultural credit societies, land development banks, commercial banks and regional rural banks, have failed to cover the entire rural farmers of the country. Red tapism à Institutional agricultural-credit is subjected to red-tapism. Credit institutions are still adopting cumbersome rules and formalities for advancing loans to farmers which ultimately force the farmers to depend more on costly non-institutional sources of credit. Government measures: Kisan credit card àThe Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was launched with the aim of providing short-term formal credit to farmers. Investment loan àLoan facility to the farmers is available for investment purposes in the areas viz. Irrigation, Agricultural Mechanization, Land Development, Plantation, Horticulture and Post-Harvest Management. Interest subvention scheme Micro-irrigation Fund under NABARD SHG Bank linkage programme AGRICULTURAL MARKETING Agricultural marketing covers all the activities in the movement of agricultural products from the farms to the consumers. Agriculture markets are regulated by APMC Acts Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act Agriculture is a state subject and almost all state governments enacted APMC act in 1950’s or so, to bring transparency and end discretion of traders. Under the APMC acts, States are geographically divided in to markets which are headed by market committees and any production in that area shall be brought to a market committee for sale. Problems of Agro-marketing in India: Large no. of middle men Lack of grading and standardization Inadequate transport system Lack of storage infra Lack of credit facility to farmers Lack of market info to farmers Indian farmers receive 25% of the retail price of their produce (US farmers get 70%) Measures taken by Government: Regulated Markets à Amendments in APMC act and ECA act are recent developments. Development of infrastructure à It includes efforts of connectivity under PMGSY, Efforts to improve other infrastructure under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana or development of food parks. Co-operative marketing à Promotion of co-operative culture and ideas like contract farming are being discussed with enthusiasm. Policy instruments à Measures like Minimum support price, buffer stock and public distribution system come under this head. E-NAM: · NAM is a pan-India electronic trading portal which seeks to network the existing APMCs and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. · Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) has been selected as the lead agency to implement it. · 585 wholesale regulated markets/ APMC Markets have been so far integrated with e-NAM platform in 16 States and 2 Union Territories (UTs). · For the local trader in the mandi / market, NAM offers the opportunity to access a larger national market for secondary trading . · Bulk buyers, processors, exporters etc. benefit from being able to participate directly in trading at the local mandi / market level, thereby reducing their intermediation costs. · Fund Allocation – The Scheme is being funded through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (AITF). · Recently, the first inter-State trade on e-Nam between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana has been carried out. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE (MSP) The MSP is the rate at which the government buys grains from farmers. Reason behind the idea of MSP is to counter price volatility of agricultural commodities due to the factors like variation in their supply, lack of market integration and information asymmetry. The MSP is fixed on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) . It is approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Prime Minister. Impact of MSP on Cropping pattern : Crop selection gets distorted in favor of those crops which have a high share of subsidies or attract large volumes of subsidies. For example, cheap electricity and irrigation subsidies motivated Punjab farmers to go for water guzzling crops like rice. NEED FOR CROP INSURANCE In our country nature has always been moody . Crop insurance provides protection to farmers against losses caused by crop failure and thereby ensures stability in farm income. It also reduces, to some extent, government expenditure incurred on relief measures extended to meet the havoc caused by natural calamities such as droughts and floods, locusts, plant diseases. It also strengthens the position of co-operatives and other institutions that finance agriculture to the extent it enables the farmer members to repay their loans in years of crop failure. By protecting the economic interest of the farmers against possible risk or loss, it accelerates adoption of new agricultural practices. It may act as an anti-inflationary measure, by locking up part of the resources in rural areas. The government launched a new crop insurance scheme, PM’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) with a view to de-risk agriculture from the vagaries of nature. FEMINIZATION OF AGRICULTURE As per the 10th Agriculture Census (2015-16), the percentage of female operational holdings in the country have increased from about 13% percent during 2010-11 to around 14% during 2015-16. Agriculture, contributing around 16% of the GDP, is increasingly becoming a female dominated activity. Agriculture sector employs 80% of all economically active women ; they comprise 33% of the agricultural labor force and 48% of self-employed farmers. About 18% of the farm families in India, according to NSSO Reports are headed by women According to the Economic Survey 2017-18 , a rise in migration of men from rural to urban areas has resulted in feminization of agriculture. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Steps Taken by Government Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) Implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, it is a programme exclusively for women farmers. It is a sub-component of Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission . It aims to empower women by enhancing their participation in agriculture and to create sustainable livelihood opportunities for them. Upto 60% (90% for North Eastern States) of the funding support for such projects is provided by the government. It is in line with the provisions of the National Policy for Farmers (2007). At least 30% of the budget allocation has been earmarked for women beneficiaries in all ongoing schemes/programmes and development activities. Government has increased its focus on women self-help groups (SHG) to connect them to micro-credit through capacity building activities and to provide information and ensure their representation in different decision-making bodies. Recognizing the critical role of women in agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has declared 15th October of every year as Women Farmer’s Day. GOVERNMENT SCHEMES Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) Objective : Ø To provide income support to all Small and Marginal land holding farmer families having cultivable land. Ø To supplement the financial needs of the farmers in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm income. Salient features: Ø Income support of Rs.6000/- per year is provided to all land holding farmer families across the country, irrespective of land size, in three equal instalments of Rs.2000/- every four months.

Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Pm Fasal Bima Yojana Every year, in one part of India or the other food crops are affected by natural calamities (like flood, drought and plant diseases). The farmers have to be assured that they will be compensated for such loss in crops. Otherwise, they cannot be drawn into the campaign to increase productivity of land under their plough. Salient features of PMFBY are as follows. PMFBY targets to cover 50% India’s cropped area in the next three years. There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops , the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%. There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if the balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government. The new scheme will also seek to address a long-standing demand of farmers and provide farm-level assessment for localized calamities, including hailstorms, unseasonal rains, landslides and inundation Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana (PM-KMDY): It is an old age pension scheme to provide social security net to around 3 crore Small and Marginal old age farmers as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood Mission For Integrated Development Of Horticulture: Promote holistic development of Horticulture sector (including bamboo & coconut) Encourage aggregation of farmers into groups such as FPOs. Enhance horticulture production, augment farmers’ income and strengthen nutritional security. Improve productivity by ways of germplasm, planting material and water use efficiency through micro irrigation. Support skill development and create employment generation opportunities. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course COOPERATIVE FARMING Cooperative farming promotes pooling of resources and practicing joint agriculture . Cooperative farming is not a new concept in India. Why Cooperative farming? Economies of scale – As the size of farms increases, the per hectare cost of using tube-well tractors comes down. Small farms – some land is wasted in forming the ‘boundaries’ among them. When they’re combined into a big cooperative farm, we can also cultivate on that boundary land. Overall, Large farms are economically more beneficial than small farms. Solves the problem of sub-division and fragmentation of holdings. Cooperative farms have more men-material-money resources to increase irrigation potential and land productivity. Members would not have been able to do it individually on their small farm. Case studies generally point out that with cooperative farming, per acre production increases . Eg AMUL in Gujarat, SOFA in Salem, MAHA farmers cooperative in Maharashtra etc CONTRACT FARMING Contract farming is the process of agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between unequal parties, companies, government bodies or individual entrepreneurs on one side and economically weaker farmers on the other which establishes conditions for the production and marketing of farm products. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Pros of contract farming from the perspective of farmers interests: Makes small scale farming competitive – small farmers can access technology, credit, marketing channels and information while lowering transaction costs Assured market for their produce at their doorsteps, reducing marketing and transaction costs It reduces the risk of production, price and marketing costs. Contract farming can open up new markets which would otherwise be unavailable to small farmers. It also ensures higher production of better quality, financial support in cash and /or kind and technical guidance to the farmers. In the case of agri-processing level, it ensures consistent supply of agricultural produce with quality, at the right time and at a lesser cost. Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020(Contract farming ordinance) It provides a framework for the protection and empowerment of farmers with reference to the sale and purchase of farm products. The provisions of the Ordinance will override all state APMC laws. Farming agreement: The Ordinance provides for a farming agreement prior to the production or rearing of any farm produce, aimed at facilitating farmers in selling farm produces to sponsors Duration of agreement: The minimum period of an agreement will be one crop season, or one production cycle of livestock. The maximum period will be five years . Exemptions from existing laws: Farming produce under a farming agreement will be exempted from all state Acts aimed at regulating sale and purchase of farming produce. Pricing of farming produce : The price to be paid for the purchase of a farming produce will be mentioned in the agreement. Delivery and payment: The Ordinance provides that the sponsor will be responsible for all preparations for the timely acceptance of deliveries and will take deliveries within the agreed time. Dispute Settlement : The Ordinance requires a farming agreement to provide for a conciliation board as well as a conciliation process for settlement of disputes Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Reinventing Agriculture in the Time of COVID-19 Peak harvest with no procurement: This is the peak of Rabi season in India and crops like wheat, gram, lentil, mustard, etc. were at a harvestable stage or almost reaching maturity. Labour unavailability due to reverse migration The shortage of migrant labour has resulted in a sharp increase in daily wages for harvesting crops. Input shortage: Due to global trade disturbance, farmers are facing the shortage of agricultural inputs like fertilizer and pesticides. Fall in prices : Agricultural prices have collapsed due to lack of market access . The rise in labour costs and Fall in prices farmers are staring at huge losses and hence allowing crops to rot in the fields, a better ‘stop-loss’ mechanism . Lockdown induced debt and Cash Flow Constraints: The most important issue that farmers have to surmount is the problem of repaying their crop loans, gold loans and other informal debts.

    "chapter_name": "ECONOMIC PLANNING",
    "content": "Economic Planning in India: Evolution, Challenges, and Transformative Initiatives To prepare for INDIAN ECONOMY for any competitive exam, aspirants have to know about Economic Planning. It gives an idea of all the important topics for the IAS Exam and the Economy syllabus (GS-II). Important Economic Planning terms are important from Economy perspectives in the UPSC exam. IAS aspirants should thoroughly understand their meaning and application, as questions can be asked from this static portion of the IAS Syllabus in both the UPSC Prelims and the UPSC Mains exams. Planning is the process through which Govt. prepares a list of socio-economic problems e.g. mass poverty, inequality, low productivity in agriculture, lack of industrial and infrastructural development etc.; and then Govt. sets goals/targets/plans to fix these problems. Note: We have dealt with Economic planning elaborately in the Indian Economy – Before and After Independence chapter. Here we will discuss planning viz-a-viz NITI Aayog briefly. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Challenges and Shortcomings in Economic Planning: A Critical Analysis of the Planning Commission’s Limitations Contextualizing India’s 9% GDP Growth: Achieved about 9% GDP growth-rate during 2005-07, thanks to the American boom prior to the Subprime crisis. But almost all nations including Pakistan had experienced high growth in that era. So 9% GDP did not come from the PC’s magic wand. Challenges and Decline Post-Subprime Crisis: Post-Subprime crisis, amid challenges in Economic Planning, GDP-fell while food-inflation &NPA rose during 2008-13. The PC couldn’t fix it. Further, PC Failed to implement land reforms, labor laws. Ineffectiveness of the Planning Commission: The PC was a toothless body, and couldn’t punish any government organizations if targets failed. Limitations in Program Design: PC designed Government schemes with ‘One Size Fits’ all approach and a few extra crores to NE, J&K, Hill-states and LWE-affected states. But for long, PC did not use pilot projects / sample testing / interaction with states. So, Indira Awas Yojana (IAY), ICDS- child development scheme etc. programs failed to show tangible results despite pumping crores of rupees over the decades. Centralization of Schemes: PC tried to bypass State Governments by designing schemes that were directly funded to NGO & private agencies. So, non-Congress states became unenthusiastic about implementing Central Schemes. Only in 2013, PC attempted to undo its mistakes by reducing the number of Centrally sponsored schemes (CSS), Performance based funding to States etc. But it was too little, too late. Transition to NITI Aayog: PC’s shortcomings resulted in creation of new bodies like PM’s Project Monitoring Group, PM’s Economic Advisory Council (PM-EAC), Group of Ministers (GoM) committees This all resulted in more lack of coordination. So, Govt. felt the PC was beyond repair & replaced it with NITI Ayog. Q. How are the principles followed by the NITI Aayog different from those followed by the erstwhile Planning Commission in India? (GSM3-2018) Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Comparing Functions: Planning Commission vs NITI Aayog in Indian Economic Planning Landscape In the economic planning of India, two key institutions have played significant roles: the Planning Commission and NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission, established in the 1950s, was a central body responsible for formulating Five-Year Plans and guiding the country’s development. On the other hand, NITI Aayog, formed in 2015, took a different approach, focusing on policy formulation, strategic advice, and fostering cooperative federalism. Here’s a comparison between the Planning Commission and NITI Aayog: Planning Commission NITI Aayog It was primarily responsible for formulating Five-Year Plans, allocating resources, and assessing plan performance. It focuses on policy formulation, providing strategic advice to the government, and fostering cooperative federalism. NITI has given responsibility to draft: Three Year Action Agenda (2017-20), Seven Year Strategy Document, Fifteen Year Vision Document (2017-32). 2018: drafted Strategy for New India @ 75 covering the period 2017 to 2022-23. It followed a more top-down approach, with a central role in setting development targets and allocating resources. It follows a more flexible and decentralized approach, encouraging states to take the lead in their own development. It followed a more centralized and directive approach to planning, with a focus on public sector-led development. It emphasizes a more market-oriented approach to development, focusing on innovation, entrepreneurship, and competitive federalism. How much money should the union give to each state for implementation of centrally sponsored schemes (CSS)? How much money should the union give to the five year plans of the state governments? PC would answer these questions using Gadgil Mukherjee formula (designed in 8TH FYP)- based on population, per capita income, special problems etc. of a state. NITI doesn’t decide how much money should be given to each state. That component is decided by the Finance Commission (tax devolution and grants) and Finance Ministry (Allocations for schemes). NITI primarily serves as the think tank, helps in policy design. Helps in monitoring schemes’ implementation through its dashboard e.g. ‘School Education Quality Index’, ‘SDG India Index’, ‘Digital Transformation Index’ etc. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Exploring Economic Planning : NITI Aayog’s Transformative Initiatives Shaping India’s Future NITI Aayog , has played a crucial role in shaping India’s development strategies. It advises the government, especially the Prime Minister, on economic matters. From initiatives like Darpan Portal for NGOs to programs like Aspirational Districts, NITI Aayog has been instrumental in driving positive change across various sectors. Here are various initiatives launched by NITI Aayog: Darpan Portal Launchd in 2017, NGO register here, get unique ID – apply for grants under various govt schemes. Aspirational District Programme Launchd in 2018, to rapidly transform 115 backward districts on 49 key performance indicators (KPIs) related to Health, Nutrition, Education, Agriculture, Water Resources, Financial Inclusion, Skill Development, Infrastructure etc. Their progress is monitored using NITI online dashboard called ‘Champions of Change’. Strategic disinvestment NITI Aayog suggested strategic disinvestment of more than 30 sick and loss-making CPSEs such as Air India, Pawan Hans Helicopter, Scooters India etc. POSHAN Abhiyaan The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) is implementing POSHAN Abhiyaan to make India malnutrition free India by 2022 with focus on pregnant women, mothers and children. NITI Vice-Chairman is the head of POSHAN Abhiyaan’s National Council. Bills and Policies Helped framing various policies on Energy, Mineral etc. Helped framing various bills, Model Acts on Agricultural Land Leasing, Livestock Selling etc. Agriculture NITI Ayog helped revamping the MSP by suggesting price deficiency payments (under PM-AASHA), & revamping fertilizer subsidies through DBT mechanism to fertilizer companies. SDG NITI Ayog developed the SDG India Index to monitor our progress in 17 SDG goals. NITI Ayog suggested Govt. to focus on methanol / biofuel based economy for reducing the fuel bill by around 30% by 2030. CSS NITI Ayog helped develop the Output Outcome Monitoring Framework to monitor the implementation of Govt schemes. Seminars NITI Ayog regularly organizes seminars, workshops, conferences for idea exchange with industries and academicians. The PC was a ‘closed / introverted body’ in terms of interaction with others. Startups NITI Ayog runs Atal Innovation Mission (AIM): grant of upto INR 10 crores to set up Atal Incubation Centers incubators. AIM also started a “Mentor India” program, wherein experts from industry provide mentorship to students in Atal incubator labs. SETU to help start ups. Digital Age NITI Ayog developing the National Program on Artificial Intelligence. It is evident that NITI’s approach is more modernized, forward-looking, less bureaucratic and less status-quo oriented than the erstwhile Planning Commission. With such initiatives, NITI Ayog is playing a pivotal role in Economic Planning for fostering economic growth, human development and good governance in India.

Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Understanding Economic Planning: Consequences of Manipulating Data and Window-Dressing- Diminished Confidence: International organizations will lose confidence in India’s data collection methodologies within the framework of economic planning. They will not believe fully, even if the Indian economy is really growing. Impact on IMF Quota and Voting Rights: Large-sized economies have to contribute more money to the IMF and, in return, get more voting rights on the IMF board (e.g. USA). But, if the IMF loses confidence in our data collection methodologies, they may not increase our quota, even if we become an economic superpower. Foreign Investment Impact: International credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s, and Fitch Group will give poor ratings to Indian G-Sec and corporate bonds. Foreign investors will feel shy about investing in India or they will demand higher interest rates.

    "chapter_name": "ECONOMIC INDICATORS",
    "content": "To prepare for the Indian Economy section in competitive exams like the IAS, aspirants need to understand economic indicators. These indicators are crucial for the Economy syllabus (GS-III) and help cover important topics for the IAS exam. Knowing the terms and their applications is essential, as questions about them can appear in both the UPSC Prelims and Mains exams. Economic Indicators are essential tools for assessing the health and progress of an economy. In India, these include measures like GDP, GNP, CPI, and various indexes such as WPI, IIP, and PPI. Understanding these indicators helps in analyzing economic growth, development, inflation, and employment trends. However, challenges in accurate estimation, limitations of GDP, and global uncertainties pose significant hurdles. India’s economic strategies, including the pursuit of a $5 trillion economy and initiatives like Atma-Nirbhar Bharat, aim to address these issues and promote sustainable growth. NATIONAL INCOME National Income is the total value of all final goods and services produced by the country in a certain year. The growth of National Income helps to know the progress of the country. In other words, the total amount of income accruing to a country from economic activities in a year’s time is known as national income. National Income includes payments made to all resources in the form of wages, interest, rent and profits . NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTING (NIA) National Income Accounting is a method or technique used to measure the economic activity in the national economy as a whole. It is the bookkeeping system which measures the level of economic activity in a given time period NIA sets rules and definition to measure aggregate economic activity and tries to summaries the performance of the economy Purpose of National Income Accounting Policy Formulation: It helps in comparing the estimates of the past from the future and also forecast the growth rates in future. Example: If a country has a GDP of Rs. 103 Lakh which is 3 Lakh rupees higher than the last year, it has a growth rate of 3 per cent. Effective Decision Making: To estimate the contribution of each of the sectors of the economy. It helps the business to plan for production. International Economic Comparison: It helps in comparing the level of development of countries and provides useful insight into how well an economy is functioning, and where money is being generated and spent. One can compare the standard of living of different nations and its growth rate. Uses of National Income Accounting Indicates the performance of the economy signifying the economy’s strength and failures It helps to find out structural changes in the economy. Example: Proportional share of primary sector is declining and tertiary sector is proportionately increasing since late 1990. It helps in assessing the current standard of living Helps in comparison among nations with respect to national income, per capita income. Data help in making suitable changes in policy and approaches to achieve rapid economic development PROBLEMS FACED IN THE ESTIMATION OF NATIONAL INCOME 1. Conceptual Problems: What should be Included or Excluded in NI? Services of household – not included as there is no income, no price and no market for service rendered for the household work done Domestic servants are to be included- but quantifying becomes difficult Farm products kept for self-consumption are to be estimated by guess. Output from veggies grown from home garden or terrace garden –not included as there is no accurate estimate for the produce. 2. Practical or Statistical problems: Small shopkeepers , casual workers etc. don’t keep a proper record of their income/expenditure; Non-market activities (self- consumption) are tough to estimate Reliable information is not available due to illiteracy Statistical staff is untrained and inefficient Large regional diversity – language , customs – create a problem in computing the estimates Issue with multiple counting PROBLEMS IN CALCULATING NATIONAL INCOME Black money outside the estimates. Non monetisation such as barter system in rural areas are kept out of transaction Household services like care economy not included Social service ,voluntary and charitable work ignored. National income calculations often overlook the environmental costs of economic activities, leading to an incomplete picture of a nation’s true wealth. PHYSICAL QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX Introduced by M D Morris in 1979, it is the average of three statistics: Basic literacy rate (at the age of 15 years), Infant mortality (death of children under the age of one year), and Life expectancy at age one, All equally weighted on a 0 to 100 scale. It was widely used till 1990, when HDI was introduced. Indicators: GDP (Gross Domestic Product ) Gross Domestic Product is the market value of all the goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during a specified time period, usually one year. Accounting Year = Fiscal Year; for India it is 1st of April to 31st of March (next year) Will include the income generated by MNCs in India Domestic Territory = Political frontiers of the country including its territorial waters+ Embassies/Consulates + Military Establishments of the country abroad + Ships/Aircrafts/Fishing Vessels/Oil Rigs belonging to the residents of the country Exclusions from GDP Calculation and Goods Classification Capital goods (e.g. machinery) are included in GDP, but intermediate goods (e.g. raw materials) are not. Intermediate goods and services are not included to avoid double counting. Same good can be final (you consuming milk ) or intermediate (milk in the restaurant) depending on the usage. Limitation to usefulness of GDP Impact on the environment may be harmful despite an increase in GDP. Only give average figure and hide stratification Conditions of poor not indicated Gender disparities not revealed. Does not matter how wealth increase… by war or demand Does not measure sustainability of growth. METHODS OF GDP CALCULATION 1. EXPENDITURE METHOD If anything is produced in India then someone must have paid money for that. So, accordingly we can derive GDP = C + I + G + X -M GDP Expenditure Method Examples (C) Consumption of final goods and services Purchasing new cars, mobiles, computers etc. Both India made & (Imported) foreign made are counted. If an existing house, its ‘notional rent’ is counted (i.e. even if you did not rent the property.) DOESN’T INCLUDE: Purchase of second hand goods, because we are only measuring ‘new’ things “MADE in India” in the present year. IGNORE of new house is not counted here, it’s counted in (I) (I) Investments Purchase of tangible capital assets like New House, Land, Building, Factory, Truck, Machinery. Purchase of intangible capital assets like IPR / Patents, Computer Software etc. Purchase of raw material & intermediate goods, wages to workers for production. Unsold inventory. DOESN’T INCLUDE: Savings in bank, shares and bonds etc. Because it’d have been given to entrepreneur as ‘Capital’ to buy above things. (G) Government Purchases Salaries to employees, Procurement of computer, stationery, fans, tube lights, vehicles etc. DOESN’T INCLUDE: Government’s scholarship, Subsidy, ‘Transfer Payments’- pension, maternity benefit, employment allowance. They’re counted in “C” (Private) consumption by the respective beneficiaries. (X-M) Export MINUS Imports Export is added because it means a foreigner must have bought goods/services “MADE in India” so it’s part of India’s GDP. Whereas, Import is subtracted because some Indians must have Consumed (C) foreign products that were not “MADE in India”, So if you do not subtract the ‘Import(M)’, it will give a wrong estimation of India’s GDP. Total = GDP The GDP thus arrived is called GDP at Current Market Price. When we adjust it with inflation against base year 2011 → GDP at Constant Market Price PRODUCTION/GVA METHOD Estimated by adding the value added by all the firms Value added = Value of Output – Intermediate good = GVA at FC If manage it with taxes and subsidies then It gives GDP at Market Price (MP) – because it includes depreciation (therefore ‘gross’) and taxes (therefore ‘market price’) To reach National Income (that is, NNP at FC) 1. Add Net Factor Income from Abroad: GNP at MP = GDP at MP + NFIA 2. Subtract Depreciation: NNP at MP = GNP at MP – Depreciation 3. Subtract Net Indirect Taxes: NNP at FC = NNP at MP – NIT While GVA gives a picture of economy from the producers’ side or supply side, the GDP model gives the picture from the consumers’ / demand side perspective. (Because it considers Indirect taxes and subsidies). Therefore, from 2018-April, RBI decided to use GDP instead of GVA to measure the economic activities for its policy making & big data analytics. GDP Calculation Discrepancies and Method Preference Theoretically, the GDP calculated by production method should equal GDP calculated by expenditure method. However, in real life, GDP (production ) does not equal to the GDP (expenditure); attributed to factory production data is systematically captured by Government machinery such as Corporate Affairs ministry’s MCA-21 portal , NSO’s Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) But, all of the final private consumption may not be captured in the official statistics due to unreported transactions (e.g. due to black money etc.) As a result, mismatch /discrepancy will be observed in GDP (expenditure) figures, and mentioned in the official NSO report. Therefore, GDP (Production Method GVA) is considered the more accurate method among the three methods (Production, Expenditure, Income). So, while NSO computes data using all 3 methods , official GDP & growth figures are presented based on the ‘ Production GVA ’ method. GDP CALCULATION METHOD → VIA INCOME (WIPR) This method follows the simple idea that whatever is “MADE in India”, its revenues must have been distributed among the factors of production. GDP = Wages to labourers (W) + Interest on Capital to Lenders (I) + Profits to Entrepreneur / Owners of the firm (P) + Rent on land (R). Estimated by adding all the factors of production (rent, wages, interest, profit) and the mixed income of self-employed. In India, one-third people are self-employed Will get GDP at factor cost. The GDP thus arrived is called GDP at Current Factor Cost . GDP CALCULATION METHOD → VIA INCOME (CSO REAL LIFE) Theoretical CSO’ real life income formula Wages Compensation (i.e. Employees salary + Employer’s contribution to his Social Security Account e.g. EPFO / ESIC). (+) Interest (+) Operating Surplus, Mixed Income. (Because in a family run farm / enterprise it is difficult to separate income and profit, unlike a corporate balance sheet) (+) Profit (+) Rent (+) Consumption of fixed assets during production Total= “GDP at Factor Cost” Here total is called “GVA at Factor Cost” GROWTH RATE GDP DEFLATOR Growth Rate (%) = [GDP (Present year – Last Year) / Last Year] x 100 But, quantitatively, the production may not have improved (From 1 kg garlic to 2 kg garlic), and only because of inflation in the prices (₹ 10/kg garlic to ₹ 100/kg) the growth rate may appear high. Therefore, (to remove the inflation impact on growth rate), we must select a base year, and convert the current prices to constant prices. The ratio of these GDPs is called ‘GDP deflator’, it presents a picture of inflation like CPI and WPI but unlike CPI & WPI it’s not based on a fixed basket of commodities. These figures are revised as new data arrives / previous data is cross verified & corrected. Example: In Jan 2019, NSO says 7.2% growth forecasted for 2018-19 (ending at 31 march 2019), then in 2019-Feb revises it downwards to 7.0%, then 2020-Jan = it says 6.8% (this figure given in Economic Survey 2020), then 2020-Feb NSO says 6.1% was the growth rate in 2018-19 NSO will also prepare quarterly growth rates (compared to previous quarters) and then engage in upwards / downwards revision. Similarly, RBI, IMF, Rating Agencies will forecast & then revise it upwards and downwards. GDP Replaced GVA (2018) While GVA gives a picture of economy from the producers’ or supply side, the GDP model gives the picture from the consumers’ / demand side perspective. (Because it considers Indirect taxes and subsidies). Therefore, Since April 2018, the RBI decided to use GDP instead of GVA to measure the economic activities for its policy making & big data analytics. GDP AND BACKSERIES CONTROVERSY During Manmohan Singh govt (PM), GDP base year was 2004-05. In 2015, PM Modi changed the GDP base year to 2011-12. Then, Manmohan Singh govt. updated / re-adjusted GDP figures as per the new base year. The (new) GDP-data thus re-produced for 2005-2011 is called “Back series” data. In August 2018, National Statistical Commission (MoSPI) → Committee on Real Sector Statistics under the Chairmanship of Dr. Sudipto Mundle discussed various approaches to prepare such Backseries. In November 2018, NITI released backseries data, showing UPA/Congress times GDP growth was pathetic. Critics alleged “Methodology is misleading, and MoSPI/CSO should have released the report. NITI Aayog should not have released it on their behalf. So, it’s all NDA governement’s manipulated data just to show his growth figures are higher.” Average Growth rate Base year 2004 Base year 2011 UPA-1 era (2004-09) 8.1% ~ 6.7% (using Backseries) UPA-2 era (2009-14) 7.0% ~ 6.7% (using Backseries) NDA-era (2014-2018*) N/A ~ 7.4% Economic Survey 2020: India GDP is not overstated. 2015 a India changed its GDP Base year from 2004 to 2011. It was done to comply with the System of National Accounts (SNA-2008) of the United Nations. Using 2011 as base year prices, India’s- Average annual GDP growth rate was approximately 7% (2011 to 2016). Average annual GDP growth rate was approximately 7.5% (for the last five years that is 2015-2019). 2019-March: Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan expressed doubt over India’s 7% growth rate. He felt it was overstated. 2019-June: Former CEA Arvind Subramanian published a research paper: He compared the growth rate figures against India’s exports, imports, loans to industry, petroleum consumption, railway freight traffic, electricity consumption, etc. He did not find strong evidence of 7% GDP growth. He estimated it’s only 4.5%. That means, India’s growth rate has been overestimated by 7.0-4.5 = 2.5%. So, if Raghuram Rajan & Arvind Subramanian are right then either: The Government’s data collection methodology is wrong and/or Collected data is manipulated / doctored. ES2020: CEA Subramanian K. has dedicated an entire chapter to prove how the above criticism (By Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian) is invalid. First rough estimate of National Income was done by Dadabhai Naoroji for 1867- 68; published in his book Poverty and Un-british rule in India (famous for its Drain of Wealth theory) First scientific estimate made by Prof V K R V Rao (1931-32) GoI estimated the National Income For the first time in 1948-49 through the Ministry of Commerce National Income Committee was set up in 1949 (Chairman – Dr P C Mahalanobis) Shifting Base Years to 2017 and 2018 In Feb 2018, MoSPI declared that it’ll ‘initiate’ steps to change base years: Indicator Present Base year Proposed New Base Year from 2019 GDP & IIP 2011 2017-18 CPI 2012 2018-19 This is proposed to ‘accommodate’ the changes take place in the economic scenario of the country (e.g. GST, Demonetization, RERA). CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF BASE YEAR Normal year – neither too high nor too low Latest possible year Relevant data for that year should be readily available CITY-LEVEL GDP (PROPOSED) In 2018, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) asked the Economist Magazine’s Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to prepare feasibility of calculating City level GDP for Indian cities. This can help the municipal administrators to know the economic potential of their area, and decide municipal property tax rates & user fees; development projects for water / sanitation / transport / infrastructure accordingly. ECONOMIC (BUSINESS) CYCLE Business cycles are fluctuations in economic activity that an economy experiences over a period of time. Business cycles are generally measured using the rise and fall in the real gross domestic product (GDP) or the GDP adjusted for inflation. It is also known as the economic cycle or trade cycle . The stages in the business cycle include a expansion, peak, recession or contraction, depression, trough, and recovery . Business cycles are measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States Expansion This is the first stage. When the expansion occurs, there is an increase in employment, incomes, production and sales. The economy has a steady flow in the money supply and investment is booming. Peak Peak is when the economy hits a snag,having reached the maximum level of growth. Prices hit their highest level, and economic indicators stop growing. Recession Phase From peak prosperity to moving downwards. Usually evident from continuous negative growth rate for two successive quarters (6 months). Example: USA 2007-09 in the aftermath of Subprime crisis Depression Phase Severe and long lasting Recession e.g. USA 1929-39 in the aftermath of stock market crash. It resulted in great fall in GDP, income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. Consumer confidence and investment levels also drop. Trough This period marks the end of the depression, leading an economy into recovery. Recovery The economy starts to turn around. Low prices spur an increase in demand, employment and production start to rise, and lenders start to open up their credit coffers. This stage marks the end of one business cycle. Notable recessions in the past: The Post-War Recession: (November 1948 – October 1949) – As returning veterans returned to the workforce in large numbers to compete for jobs with existing civilian workers who had entered the workforce during the war, unemployment began to rise. The Oil Crisis Recession: (November 1973 – March 1975) This long, deep recession was brought on by the quadrupling of oil prices and high government spending on the Vietnam War, which further led to stagflation and high unemployment. The Iran/Energy Crisis Recession: (July 1981 – November 1982) This long and deep recession was caused by the regime change in Iran, which exported oil at inconsistent intervals and at lower volumes, forcing prices higher. The Gulf War Recession: (July 1990 – March 1991) Iraq invaded Kuwait. This resulted in a spike in the price of oil in 1990, which caused manufacturing trade sales to decline. The 9/11 Recession (March 2001 – November 2001): The collapse of the dotcom bubble, the 9/11 attacks contributed to this relatively mild contraction of the U.S. economy. The Subprime Mortgage Crisis/Great Recession (2007): It was a period of marked general recession observed in national economies globally. It was concluded as the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression by the IMF. The emergence of sub-prime loan losses in the US in 2007 began the crisis and exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. COVID 19 and Recession: According to the latest United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) analysis, the world economy will go into recession due to the coronavirus pandemic. The commodity-rich exporting countries will face a $2-$3 trillion drop in investments from overseas in the next two years. This would spell serious trouble for developing countries, with the exception of China and India. However, an explanation as to why and how India and China will be the exceptions is not given in the report. Fiscal and forex constraints are bound to tighten further over the course of the year. UNCTAD has therefore called for a $2.5 trillion rescue package for these nations. POST-COVID-19: V-SHAPED RECOVERY FOR INDIA If GDP growth suffers a sharp economic decline, then quickly recovers. So the graph will appear “V- shaped“. Spanish Flu (1918- 1920): USA growth falls to (3.5%)→afterwards quickly recovers to(7.5%)= V-shaped recovery. In 2020, CEA Subramanian K. predicts, “History will repeat it self for India-If Corona Vaccine is found sooner.” GDP GROWTH OF INDIA AND ECONOMIC SURVEY 2020 According to ES2020, GDP Growth rate of India & World is reducing. Real Growth 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21(Estimated) India 7.2% 6.8% 5.05 = 5.8% (IMF’s world economic outlook) >> 5.8% World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects GDP GROWTH OF INDIA AND ECONOMIC SURVEY 2020 Protectionism in China And the USA and US-Iran geopolitical tensions which have affected global trade. Consequently, investment and manufacturing production have decreased even in the G7 and OECD group of countries. India’s not the only country suffering from exports. Sharp decrease in the automobile purchase. This problem will further worsen with Bharat-6 emission norms. Such vehicles are more expensive compared to the previous models. Real Growth 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 (Estimated) → 6.0-6.5% as per Economic Survey 2019-20 World 3.8% 3.6% 2.9% 3.3% (IMF’s world economic outlook)* VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF GROWTH In India, investment slowed down in the aftermath of mounting Non-performing assets – Twin balance sheet syndrome (TBS) & IL&FS-NBFC Crisis Although things are improving, but, it takes two to four years for the cycle to restart again IMF research found that if there is a sudden uptake in loans, it will increaseproduction, employment and demand. But this positive effect remains only for a short term. In the long term, it will cause a decrease in growth rate. Same has happened in India, during the mid-2000s (before the subprime crisis), the lending quantity was very high, resulting in a later decrease in growth. According to critics, the demonetization and GST too have harmed the growth rate but ES20 chose to remain silent on that part. CHALLENGES OF DECLINING GROWTH RATE: ECONOMIC SURVEY 2020 US-Iran geo-political tensions will increase crude oil price → weaker rupee → higher inflation → reduced consumption → GDP declines. Even after the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code, the bad loan resolution process has been very slow. Banks reluctant to give loans to the corporate sector → GDP unable to expand. The Government’s National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) aims to spend 102 lakh crore on infrastructure in the next five years. But then the government will have to borrow more money → rise in fiscal deficit → crowding out of the private investors → GDP unable to expand. Unless real estate developers reduce home prices, It is difficult to sell the unsold homes → Builders will not build new homes → decrease in demand of Steel and cement → GDP unable to expand. 2019: India is among the top 5 economies of the world in terms of GDP at current US$ trillion i.e. USA (21 Tn$), China ($14), Japan ($5), Germany ($3.9), India ($2.9) 2024-25: We plan to increase the size of our economy to 5 trillion. But to achieve this, we need a 9% GDP Growth rate annually, which is rather difficult because presently we are struggling around 5% & Corona lockdown will make the matters worse. Global Risk Report World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) Global Risks Report 2020 shows the global risks over the coming decade. Notable risks are: 2020: Weather, climate, natural disasters, biodiversity loss, water crisis, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) 2019: Similar to above and cyber security , data theft, data fraud. Declining Growth Rate and India Among the BRICS Nations, India’s growth rate is still relatively better and stable than Brazil, China, Russia. Even though the GDP growth rate is falling, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) SENXSEX is improving. Both domestic and foreign investors are still investing enthusiastically in the shares of companies, Which means they are confident that the Indian economy will improve in the upcoming days. By doing the quarterly growth analysis since 1996, CEA Subramanian K. found India’s business cycle is about 13 quarters . Meaning, after every 13 quarters, we will achieve the highest level and then it will start to fall. Presently we are at the “ Fall phase ”, But definitely improve after that as per the historic trend of our business cycles. World Bank-ICP’s GDP series based on PPP UN Economic And Social Council→United Nations Statistical Commission→ International Comparison Program (ICP) ICP’s goal is to convert data on Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) so GDP and price levels can be compared. More on PPP. 2020-June World Bank released new data sets for 2017,using ICP. GDP for 2017 Entire World #1 China #2 USA #3 India $1= rupee 21 (PPP) (PPP $, Trillion) 120 Trillion Abt 20 trillion Abt 20 trillion 8 trillion % of total 1005 16.4% 16.3% 6.7% Budget-2019 and $5 Trillion Economy Year India’s GDP in trillion $ (Current Prices) 2014-15 1.85 trillion 2018-19 2.70 trillion 2019-20 2.90 trillion 2024-25 5 trillion targeted In Aug 2019, GDP growth sharply fell, FPIs exiting on large scale from India. So, Finance Minister Nirmala. S announced Fiscal Stimulus. Rangarajan (Former RBI Governor) opinion a India cannot achieve a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2025, because to achieve it, we will have to grow at 9-10% annually but at present we are struggling with 5-6% growth rate. ES2020 strategy to Achieve $5 Trillion Economy Savings: It’s the Income excess of Consumption. Subdivided into Private Savings [by households & business firms] and Public Savings by Govt organizations. Investment: It’s the domestic Savings + NET foreign money which is put in Real (physical) Assets like machines, tools, buildings, office spaces, storehouses, roads, bridges, airports GFCF a Gross Fixed Capital Formation Rate (GFCF) = INVESTMENT – DISPOSAL of assets (liquidation, condemnation). Thus, GFCF shows the net increase in physical assets. It does not consider depreciation, and land purchases. Capital Output Ratio : It is the amount of capital needed to produce one unit of output. It depends on factors such as technological progress, prices of capital goods / machinery. In India, High Capital Ratio is among the reasons for subdued growth rates. ES2018 had observed: Pre-Subprime crisis, above indicators had peaked over 30% of GDP. But then falling down, then struggling zig-zag. Pre-subprime crisis our growth rate was at peak 9%, presently struggling in ~7% range. Some countries take as much as 17 years to come out of such a crisis. If we want to quickly recover, & bring our growth rate back to 9% then we must increase investment → GFCF will increase → the growth rate will automatically increase → savings will automatically increase. Increasing Investment / GCFC: should be our urgent priority: Resolve TBS, Encourage Make in India & Startup India, Reforms in Tax Laws Labour Laws, Environment Clearance, Faster FDI approval etc. Increasing / Mobilizing Savings: It is important but should not be our urgent priority: PMJDY, Pension-Insurance schemes, Sovereign Gold Bonds, Unearthing black money, Demonetization etc. Economic Survey 2019 also reiterated the similar theme, that private investment is necessary for boosting growth . Q. Economic growth in country X will occur if______(CSE-2013) There is technical progress in the world economy. There is population growth in X. There is capital formation in X. The volume of trade grows in the world economy. Q. Despite being a high saving economy, capital formation may not result in significant increase in output due to____________(CSE-2018) Weak administrative machinery Illiteracy High population density High capital-output ratio $5 Trillion Economy: Strategy of NITI to Achieve 1. Increase the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) from present 29% → 36% of GDP by 2022-23. To increase Public Sector and/or Government led-investment: Must improve Tax to GDP ratio by combating tax evasion and tax avoidance. Must decrease Revenue deficit by combating Subsidy leakage through JAM-trinity. Government has to exit from loss-making public sector enterprises. To mobilize private households’ investment– PPP for Infrastructure. To mobilize domestic and foreign company investments, address the NPA crisis, reform FDI policy, and improve the Ease of Doing Business. Greater coverage in Sovereign Gold Bond, Jan Dhan Account, Pension-Insurance schemes etc; Preventing Ponzi & Chit Fund scams. 2. Increase India’s growth rate to 9- 10%. Increase size of Indian economy (GDP) to $5 trillion USD. For this we must increase our ‘Net Exports’: Address various bottlenecks in our agriculture and manufacturing sector. Ease the complex labour and land laws. Industrial Revolution 4.0, artificial intelligence, IoT etc. Skilling Youth, increasing female participation in the labour force. Renewable energy to decrease import bills. Trade agreements with like-minded countries & regional blocks 5 Trillion Economy: Conclusion Higher economic growth can help increase employment avenues for citizens and tax revenues for the Governments. Collectively, this results in improved living standards through higher expenditure on health & education by both the citizens and the State. Therefore, we must leave no stone unturned to accomplish above targets / address above challenges on priority basis. Wealth Creation and ES2020 Until the entry of Europeans, India has been the dominant global economic power. Then our GDP growth started to decline during British Raj and Nehruvian Socialism. But since 1991’s LPG reforms, again we are back on track. Benefits of Wealth Creation by Private Entrepreneurs: ES2020 Employees, suppliers, retailers a increase income, jobs and employment opportunities. Government: Enhancing and broadening of tax collection Common citizen: Increased quality of roads, schools, hospitals created through the tax revenue Ancient and modern thinkers/economists to suggest how to broaden our wealth: CEA Subramanian K Thinker How CEA Subramanian K. links their ideas with wealth creation Kautilya Kautilya’s Arthashastra book is centred around Varta (economic policy), Dandaneeti (law and enforcement), Anvikshiki(philosophical and ethical framework) and Trayi (cultural context) Kautilya asked the King to remove all obstructions to economic activity and provide economic freedom to the citizens. So, incumbent govt should also focus on Ease of Doing Biz Thiruvalluvar Tamil Poet and Philosopher Thiruvalluvar’s Thirukkural book advocates wealth creation through ethical means. Govt should provide equal opportunity for new entrepreneurs, incumbent govt should avoid Pro-Crony policies of Manmohan Singh Govt.→ improve EoD. There should be no shame in privatization (Strategic disinvestment) of the government companies, Because after privatization their profitability has increased. Adam Smith (Father of Economics) Adam Smith’s book ‘An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of Wealth of Nations’ described “Invisible hand of the free market is instrumental in economic growth”. But Government intervention in the free market often harms more than it helps. David Hume, Scottish Philosopher “We should assume every man is a dishonest person, his actions are always driven by private interest. So, effective supervision is required”. So, we’ve to regulate the Shadow banking sector more vigorously. We must deal with the wilful defaulters responsible for the high level of NPA. Use Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning etc. also envisaged and create PSBN network. · American Share market regulators has 15x times the number of employees than SEBI. So, we also need to increase manpower in regulatory bodies. Motivation Maslow’s Motivational Pyramidà “Individuals are not driven just by physical / material, but they also have needs of self-esteem and self-actualization”. Confucius: “if the Government guides the people with penalties → they’ll shamelessly evade the law. But if the Government guides them with virtue → people will become upright.” Therefore, we should use the ideas of behavioral economics to increase their morale to: Give up subsidies and Honestly pay taxes Trust Adam Smith’s book ‘The Theory of Moral Sentiments’ described, “while people are sometimes selfish, they also derive pleasure from seeing the happiness of others. Absence of such mutual sympathy / trust can result in financial disasters, as seen in the Subprime Crisis, Global Financial Crisis, India’s NPA & Wilful defaulters. So, trust is a ‘public good’ similar to ‘public park’– everyone benefits from it. Governments & entrepreneurs should try to build trust with citizens and with each other. Economic Policy Uncertainty and ES2019 Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) index Started in 2016, by three US-based economists—Scott Ross Baker, Nick Bloom and Steven J. Davis. They capture countries’ newspapers’ headlines related to economic policy uncertainty, and then rank the nation accordingly. 2011-12: economic policy uncertainty was the highest in India due to events like 2G Scam, Coal Allocation Scam, Subprime Crisis, Global Financial Crisis. During this time, the government did not take the corporate friendly reform decisions or revert its original decisions fearing the media scrutiny, judicial scrutiny, protest by the labour unions. Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index EPU index has been developed by Baker, Bloom and Davis . The index is created by quantifying newspaper coverage of policy-related economic uncertainty. The index reflects the frequency of articles in leading newspapers that contain ‘economic’ the following or triple: ‘economy’; ‘uncertain’ or ‘uncertainty’; and one or more policy related words like ‘fiscal policy’, ‘monetary policy’, ‘PMO’, ‘parliament’ etc. 2016-17: increased due to Demonetization, GST. But during this stage it was not as bad as the uncertainty during 2011-12. From 2014 onwards India’s EPU has declined although in a zigzag manner with occasional spikes during Demonetization – GST etc. Whereas Global EPU has increased in a zigzag manner- due to the Policies pursued by Donald Trump, BREXIT, Iran, N.Korea, OPEC, Trade war between USA and China etc. During High EPU: domestic investors hold up their decision to invest into the financial market. They prefer to invest in gold (large BOP), land / real estate (Black money). FPI inflows decline during the volatility of exchange rate. However, the relationship between FDI growth and exchange rate is weak. Because Foreign Direct Investors are entering a market for the long term. They look at multiple factors beyond just the exchange rate. They look at taxation, monetary policy, consumer sentiment etc. all which are reflected by EPU. Low growth of FPI, FDI = Corporates are deprived of the new capital from the domestic and foreign investors → it affects the factory expansion, job creation and GDP growth. Addressing Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU): ES2019 Reducing economic policy uncertainty is critical for both domestic investment and foreign investment. Therefore, ES2019 suggested following reforms: Making Policies more predictable Top-level policymakers must ensure that their policy actions are predictable. E.g. From which date Bharat Stage emission norms will become effective? From which date GAARor E-Way Bill will become effective? Union Budget (2016) proposed to impose income tax on the money withdrawn by subscribers from his EPF fund. Later, due to labour unions backlash it was reverted. The Union Budget (2019) proposed to hike surcharge on the income tax of the super-rich, then due to a backlash by foreign investors, it was reverted. Respect Boundaries Judiciary, legislature and executive should respect each other’s boundaries. Executive and legislature should not create a vacuum which could encourage Judicial Overreach such as firecracker ban, or no selling of liquor on highway hotels, which may create new challenges in the economy. Keep Consistency in Promises Government / Regulators should maintain broad consistency in actual policy with forward guidance. They should reduce ambiguity/arbitrariness in policy implementation. E.g. 2018-Dec: Monetary policy Committee keeping “Calibrated Tightening”. Means in the next meeting they would either ‘hold’, or ‘increase’ repo rate. No chance of cutting the repo rate. Yet in 2019-Feb, they cut the repo rate. Similarly, the Government should avoid changing the goalposts and deadlines of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. Then consistency becomes hard to find and harder to follow. Monitoring Policy Implementations “What gets measured gets acted upon”. Therefore, the Government must monitor its performance in the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index on a quarterly basis. We should construct India-specific sub-indices of economic uncertainty To monitor our performance. The actual implementation of policy occurs at the lower levels, where ambiguity gets created and it compounds the economic policy uncertainty. Therefore, staff should be trained and implementation processes should be certified (by NITI etc) before implementing policy. Poorly drafted laws full of ambiguities, amendments, clarifications and exemptions = endless litigation. Example: Provisions related to Capital Gains Tax in the Income Tax Act 1961: Vodafone-Hutch case. Policy Uncertainty: Conclusion India faces economic uncertainty from many fronts which are beyond our control Example: Poor monsoon, BREXIT, OPEC Oil cuts, Geopolitical disturbance in the Korean Peninsula and Western Asia (Iran), protectionism and tariff wars. While policymakers cannot control above ‘economic and diplomatic uncertainties’, they can definitely control economic policy uncertainty. Successive economic surveys have found that greater private investment is necessary for economic growth in India. EPU can spook investors and spoil the investment climate in the economy, therefore the Government must strive for 100% policy certainty on the economic fronts. $5 TRILLION ECONOMY AND ATMA-NIRBHAR BHARAT 2020-March: Government of India initiated nation-wide lockdown to prevent the spread of Corona/COVID-19 pandemic. This lockdown affected the income and livelihood of everyone from corporate companies to common citizens of India. Therefore to revive the economy ,Prime Minister of India launched the AtmaNirbhar Bharat stimulus package in 2020-May to revive the Indian economy. It’s Centred on Five Pillars : Economy, Infrastructure, System, Demand and Vibrant Demography Country Japan Malaysia Singapore India Stimulus package as a % of GDP 20% 16.2% 12.2% Just 10% If Government Tried to Give Bigger Fiscal Stimulus then- Rise in Fiscal Deficit will result in low rating by Credit Rating Agencies. This has impact on Flight of Foreign Investors Currency exchange rate volatility. If the deficit is monetized by RBI printing more currency → demand side inflation like Post-WW1. Conclusion Thus, Atmanirbhar bharat focuses on the well-being of the poors, credit to MSME, ease of doing biz for the corporate sector, reforms in agriculture and catalysing the development of infrastructure. GNP TO NNP TO PER CAPITA INCOME Primary income (or factor income) includes wages, interest, profit, and rent Secondary income (or transfer payments) includes gifts, donations, charities, fines GNP: It is the total value of final goods and services by normal residents of India within an accounting year. GDP: It includes the contribution made by non-resident producers – who work in the domestic territory of other countries – by way of wages, rent, interest and profits. Example: The income of all people working in Indian banks abroad is the factor income earned abroad. Net Factor Income from Abroad: is the difference between the income received from abroad for rendering factor services and the income paid for the factor services rendered by non-residents in the domestic territory of a country. GNP= India’s GDP + Primary income earned by residents from overseas- Primary income earned by non-residents from India. In brief, GNP (Market Prices) = GDP + NFIA (net factor income from abroad). GNP ignores secondary income , the incomes from sale of second hand (used) goods. Whenever something is produced, capital assets get consumed due to wear and tear. This wear and tear is called Depreciation. Since, depreciation does not become part of anybody’s income, so it has to be subtracted. Net National Product (NNP at Market Price) = GNP – Depreciation. Net Domestic Product (NDP) = GDP – Depreciation However, here we are getting the NNP at ‘Market Prices’. We have to convert it to Factor cost. NNP (Factor Cost) = NNP (Market Price) (-) Indirect Taxes (+) Subsidies. Theoretically, ‘net’ is a better measure of the health of an economy than ‘gross’ but it is difficult to estimate net values. Therefore, GDP & GNP are commonly used measures . Per Capita Income 2016 2017 2018-19 2019-20* Population in Crores 129 131 >133cr >134cr Per capita income at Current Prices 104659 114958 >126000 >135000 At Constant Prices (BaseYear 2011) 82931 87623 >92000 >96000 NEW ECONOMIC WELFARE The major problem of GNP as a measure of welfare is that it measures the commercial transactions taking place in the economy, while the welfare of the individuals depends on many other non-transactional aspects. This concept of NEW was popularized by Paul Samuelson . NEW ECONOMIC WELFARE = GNP + Housewives’ Services + Value of Leisure – Expenditure on defence – Cost of Environmental degradation. Practically, it is tough to estimate this. Therefore, it was not widely adopted. PER CAPITA INCOME (PCI) Per capita income (PCI) measures the average income earned per person in a given area, in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area’s total income by its total population. It is not a satisfactory indicator of economic development because it increases if the overall national income increases, without regard to the composition of the national income. For example, even if the government produces a lot of weapons during war, PCI will go up. It does not take into account the welfare dimension (poverty, literacy, political liberty, environment etc). FACTOR COST (FC) Vs MARKET PRICE (MP) FC includes rent, wages, interest and profit. FC is used for estimating growth (e.g. our annual GDP numbers) NNP (Factor Cost) is the National Income of India MP = FC + Net Indirect Taxes (taxes on goods and services ) Net Indirect Taxes = Indirect Taxes – Subsidies Therefore, GDP at MP = GDP at FC + Net Indirect Taxes GDP at MP can increase merely by increasing the taxes, even without increase in production CURRENT PRICES Vs CONSTANT PRICES Current Values estimated at prevailing (current) prices GDP at current prices is called Nominal GDP Govt always gets its data in terms of Nominal GDP and then converts it to Real GDP GDP at current price can increase because of inflation – not a true indicator of increase in production. So it is not used. Constant Values estimated at the prices of a base year For India, the base year is 2011-12 (earlier it was 2004-05) GDP at constant prices is called Real GDP Growth is always estimated at constant price So, when we say that the GDP growth rate of India in 2016-17 was 6.5 %, it is estimated at factor cost and constant prices. GDP at Constant Prices is called Real GDP – it cannot increase without a real increase in production. GDP AND NATIONAL INCOME Gross National Income (GNI) According to OECD, GNI as GDP + NET receipts from abroad (wages, interest, profit, rent) plus net taxes & subsidies receivable from abroad. Here, ‘Wages and salaries’ from abroad = ‘Guest’ workers who reside abroad for less than 12 months and whose centre of economic interest remains in their home country National Disposable Income National Disposable Income= NNP + Other Current Transfers from rest of the world (remittances, gift, donations etc.) National Disposable Income gives an idea of what is the maximum amount of goods and services the domestic economy has at its disposal. Personal Disposable Income(PDI) PDI= Personal Income – Personal Tax Payments (e.g. income tax) – Non-tax Payments (e.g. fines) World Development Report by World Bank The World Bank has published it annually since 1978. Earlier, the World Bank used above income classifications for analytical purposes only. But from 2018, high income countries are required to pay an “extra surcharge” on loan interest by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Types of Country Defined in Terms of Gross National Income (GNI) per Person High Income $12,376 or more e.g. Israel (its GNI >$40,000) Upper – Middle Income $3,996 and $12,375 e.g. China (its GNI >$9,000) Lower – Middle Income $1,026 and $3,995; e.g. India (its GNI >$2,000) Low Income $1,025 or less LIMITATIONS OF GDP Impact on the environment may be harmful despite an increase in GDP. Only give average figure and hide stratification Conditions of poor not indicated Gender disparities not revealed. Does not matter how wealth increase either by war or demand Does not measure sustainability of growth CRITICISM OF GDP & PER CAPITA INCOME 1. GDP doesn’t give us true picture of Indian economy because: Presence of an unorganised sector of the economy implies that not all the production data is captured. To avoid any scrutiny by income tax and GST tax officials, the businessmen deliberately show a low level of production during the surveys conducted by CSO/NSSO/NSO/MOSPI. Large size of parallel economy which functions on black money and cash. 2. Provides only a quantitative picture and does not consider the qualitative aspects / negative externalities Example: More coal based thermal power production= more GDP, disregarding how much pollution it created. Economist Peter Wood (1980s) came up with the Green accounting & Green GDP concept to consider environmental costs as well. 3. Ignores non-market activities. domestic work done by mother. 4. Ignores the Opportunity Cost. A child labour produced ₹ 25000 rupees worth firecracker annually which will be added in GDP. But, child labourer could not pursue education else he could have become a doctor/engineer and produced ₹ 5,00,000 worth of annual goods and services – such angles are not considered in computing GDP. 5. Ignores inequality of income among people. Later on Gross Happiness Index, Physical Quality Of Life Index, Human Development Index etc were invented. Two Data Collection Agencies in India Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) Estimates National Income CSO with a new series of national accounts with 2011-12 base year for computing size of economic growth. It includes data on unorganised manufacturing and services. National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) Collects data on employment, poverty, consumption, expenditure, etc Sample Surveys conducted annually, but Large Sample Surveys conducted every 5 years . Economic Growth Vs Economic Development Growth If the production of goods and services increases, we call it Economic Growth Development It means that the process of Economic Growth which leads to improvement in the general welfare of people is called Economic Development. It means progressive changes in the socio-economic structure of the country. Sustainable Development is development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. GROWTH Increase in production Quantitative Uni dimensional Indicator are real GDP and real per capita income Can happen without development DEVELOPMENT Increase prod. And welfare Qualitative Multi dimensional Indicator are human development index, physical quality of life index, net economic welfare cannot happen without growth Q. Increase in absolute and per capita real GNP do not connote a higher level of economic development, if_______________(CSE-2018) Industrial output fails to keep pace with agricultural output. Agricultural output fails to keep pace with industrial output. Poverty and unemployment increase. Imports grow faster than exports.

INDICATORS: INFLATION Inflation is defined as a situation where there is sustained, unchecked increase in the general price level and a fall in the purchasing power of money. Inflation is a condition of price rise. The reason for price rise can be classified under two main heads: Increase in demand Reduced supply. Deflation is the inverse of the above definition. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% Example: Suppose for Rs.100, last week you bought 10 pens. This means that the cost of 1 pen was Rs. 10. This week when you approached the same shop- keeper and paid Rs.100 to get 10 pens, he gave only 5 pens. He also explained that the price of pen has increased, and now the price of one pen is 20. INFLATIONARY AND DEFLATIONARY GAPS In his book “General Theory on employment, interest, money”, British Economist J.M.Keynes (1883) said, “when the economy is functioning at full employment, aggregate supply will match aggregate demand.” At this equilibrium, we will have ‘General Price’ level → any increase → inflation, any decrease → deflation. Aggregate Demand = Consumption(C) + Investments(I) + Govt Purchases (G) + {Exports (X) –– Imports (M)} Inflationary Gap: It could have occurred because of: ↑ Money supply ↑ Propensity to consume ↑ Investment expenditure ↑ Fiscal deficit ↑ NET exports High growth → higher Aggregate demand → could lead to inflation. Deflationary Gap: It could have occurred because of ↓ Money supply ↑ Propensity to save / Consumer delaying purchase with hopes of further fall in prices ↓ Investment expenditure ↑ Fiscal consolidation ↓ NET exports Depression / Recession that results into falling ‘Aggregate demand’. Deflationary gap: Aggregate supply > Aggregate demand (at full employment level) Inflationary Spiral When inflation increases, workers demand higher wages to keep up with the cost of living. Firms pass these higher labor costs on to their customers, resulting in higher prices, more inflation. Deflationary Spiral Fall in prices → lower profit to firm → lower production, lower wages / workers laid off → lower demand → lower prices → and same cycle goes on. Q. A rise in general level of prices may be caused by___________________________(CSE – 2013) An increase in the money supply. A decrease in the aggregate level of output. An increase in the effective demand. Answer Codes: (a) 1 only (b) 1 and 2 only (c) 2 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3 Q. Economic growth is usually coupled with__________________________(CSE – 2011) Deflation Inflation Stagflation Hyperinflation INFLATION: TYPES BASED ON CAUSATION Demand Pull Inflation It is “too much money chasing too much goods”. Prices are rising because people have excess money à demands for goods and services that exceed the available supply. MGNREGA, pay commission, PM KISAN scheme, Universal Basic Income (UBI) could result in this. Monetary Inflation When RBI printing of more money results in inflation Cost-Push Inflation Price rise due to increased cost of inputs e.g. Expensive crude oil means higher costs for transport companies. Trade / labour unions’ protests and strikes → wage hike. Natural disasters → lower potato and chilly production → chip makers have to pay more for inputs. Profit – Push Inflation When Cartels / Monopolists / Oligopolists deliberately cut down the supply / production or hike the prices because of greed / profit motive. Example: OPEC group oil production cut. Built-in-Inflation Linked to the “price/wage inflationary spiral,” i.e. when inflation rises, workers demand higher wages to keep up with the cost of living; firms pass these higher labor costs on to their customers as higher prices; more inflation. Repressed Inflation During war, Govt imposes price controls and rationing to keep prices under check. But the moment such controls are withdrawn, prices will go up (because traders will want to cover up their previous losses by raising prices). This is called Repressed Inflation. Stagflation Persistent high inflation, high unemployment and low growth resulting into a stagnant economy. Skewflation Term to denote episodic price rise in one / small group of commodities while Inflation in the remaining goods and services remain usual. Example: pulse / tomato / onion inflation in India. Headline Inflation It is the measure of the total inflation within an economy, usually presented in the form of CPI or WPI. Core Inflation Headline inflation minus inflation in food & energy articles. Accordingly, it can be CPI (Headline) or WPI (Headline). Reflation Philip curve we learned that deflation = unemployment, so, RBI tries to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply, and the government tries to give ‘fiscal stimulus’ by reducing taxes / increasing public procurement Such actions take the economy from deflationary path towards an inflationary path, this process is ‘called’reflation’. Structural Inflation Inflation that is part of a particular economic system. A complete change in economic policy would be needed to get rid of it. Example: . To keep farmers happy, the government keeps raising MSP for wheat and rice but not so much for pulses, → inflation in pulses. APMC reforms not taken: cartelization & hoarding; inflation in vegetables. When global crude prices are falling, the government raises Excise / VAT to get more money for their schemes, so petrol-diesel are not getting cheaper, & so on… Hoarding Inflation Accumulation of huge quantities of goods and releasing them into the market in conditions of scarcity at higher prices. Imported Inflation: Country depends on imports has its prices rising due to the exchange rate. Implications of Stagflation for policy making Stagflation is considered to be a problematic condition for governments to handle. This is because; It presents a situation where, despite low demand, prices keep going up. When an economy is in recession, the governments try to revive it by cutting interest rates or increasing government spending to boost demand, which leads to inflation. However, these inflationary measures cannot be applied in stagflation because inflation is already very high and such measures would further result in prices spiraling out of control. INFLATION TYPES BASED ON SPEED OF INCREASE Creeping Inflation: ~4% per annum. It’s regarded as safe and essential for job creation and economic growth. Walking / Trotting Inflation: Over 4% onwards → Running Inflation is when it shifts to double digit. Galloping / Hyperinflation: Very high level. 20%-100% and sometimes even 10,000% or more, as observed in Germany after the Treaty of Versailles due to the monetized deficit. Modern day Venezuela and Zimbabwe due to the misgovernance of ruling parties, resulting in a broken economy and a shortage of essential commodities. Here, money becomes quite worthless and new currency may have to be introduced. Q. Which one of the following is likely to be the most inflationary in its effect? (CSE – 2013) Repayment of public debt Borrowing from the public to finance a budget deficit Borrowing from banks to finance a budget deficit Creating new money to finance a budget deficit Base Effect of Inflation Suppose price of 1 kg tomatoes is 100 (2010), 110 (2011), 120 (2012). So, as such their price is increasing at the rate of ₹ 10 per year. However, the percentage rise in inflation over previous year is 10% for 2011 (110 vs 100), and 9.09% for 2012 (120 vs 110). Thus, the choice of base (denominator) could make the inflation look too high or too low, even if the price rise has been the same. Q. A rapid increase in the rate of inflation is sometimes attributed to the “base effect”. What is “base effect”?(CSE-2011) It is the impact of drastic deficiency in supply due to failure of crops It is the impact of the surge in demand due to rapid economic growth It is the impact of the price levels of previous year on the calculation of inflation rate None of the statements EFFECTS OF INFLATION ON INDIVIDUALS Effect During Inflation During Deflation On Businessman, Borrowers They make huge profits because the price of the final product is rising at a much faster rate than the price of raw materials. They make losses because prices of final products fall faster than the cost of production.→ lay-off workers to cut salary bills. On Fixed Income Groups, Lenders Salaried individual, pensions suffer. Lenders suffer because even if borrowed money is returned their ‘real Purchasing Power’ would have declined due to the fall in Real Interest Rate. While they will benefit because the value (purchasing power) of money will increase, some workers / employees will lose their jobs during deflation as per the Philip Curve. Currency Itself Since the rupee’s purchasing power will decline, its exchange rate value will weaken against foreign currencies, as foreigners get less keen to buy from India. Reverse will happen. Q. Find correct statement(s): (CSE-2013) Inflation benefits the debtors. Inflation benefits the bondholders. Both A and B Neither A nor B IMPACT OF INFLATION Positive Impact: Inflation is good for the economy, upto reasonable limits. This, according to RBI is 5%. Moderate inflation stimulates growth. Moderate inflation allows for price adjustments. Moderate inflation allows adjustment of real wages. Inflation may reduce the severity of economic recession. Tobin effect – can increase the investment. Negative Impact Real income of people would decrease. Inflation is regressive in nature. Would increase income inequalities. Capital formation is adversely affected. Interest rates were increased by RBI. Promote hoarding and speculation. Thus Promotes generation of Black Money. Standard of living would be reduced. COMBATING INFLATION OR DEFLATION Agency Fighting Inflation Fighting Deflation RBI Tight / dear / Hawkish Monetary Policy to make the loans expensive Cheap / Easy / Dovish – to make loans cheaper Government Tax deduction / exemption / subsidy benefits towards producers to decrease the cost of production. Curtailing Fiscal Deficit. Curtailing schemes and subsidies that are increasing money in the hands of beneficiary without increasing production. Ordering RBI to issue inflation Indexed Bonds, Sovereign Gold Bonds Essential commodities act, Stock limits, minimum export price, FCI’s Open Market Sale Scheme, Operation Greens for TOP, Price stabilisation fund, Offering higher MSP to farmers to increase cultivation of a particular crop etc. Tax deduction / exemption / subsidy type benefits to consumers to encourage purchase / consumption. (e.g. cut GST on Television, Computers, Cars) Increasing the expenditure on public projects e.g. highway, dam etc. to boost demand in steel / cement industry → workers get money → demand → towards inflation . CPI, WPI, IIP & OTHERS Laspeyre German economist Etienne Laspeyres formula is used in calculation of WPI, CPI and IIP index. It is a weighted arithmetic mean (average) of a basket of commodities that tracks price / production level against the base year. Paasche Index German economist Hermann Paasche’s index tells us what today’s “Basket” of commodities would have cost at the base year’s price. Fisher Index American Economist Irving Fisher’s index is the Geometric mean of (Laspeyrese and Passche), to give a more accurate picture.

Core CPI Headline CPI Minus Inflation in food & energy) Inflation Rate: How is It Calculated? Index value of Headline CPI (All India) was 148.6 (2019-Nov) and 140.8 (2018-Nov). Therefore, Trend CPI was towards the inflationary path in the UPA/Manmohan era. CPI was towards deflationary path during the Modi 1.0 era (2014-19)- mainly due to falling food prices. Food commands ~46% weight in CPI calculation. Modi 2.0 era (2019-May onwards): back to inflationary path due to oil, onion etc. Wholesale Price Index, EA-DPIIT, Base: 2011 Monthly WPI Components in Descending Order → Wt.

Whereas, PPI covers both goods and services. It measures price change from sellers’ perspective. OECD nations use PPI to measure inflation at wholesale level. Their PPI only measures price (and not PRICE + Taxes). 2014: DPIIT setup Dr. B.N.Goldar Committee to explore this for India. Experimental Service Price Index EA to DPIIT preparing these experimental indices separately for Railway Services, Port Services, Air Services, Postal Services, Telecom Services, Banking Services, Insurance, Banking Business Service Price by RBI. It measures the inflation in the fees charged by Banks for NEFT- RTGS, Mobile Banking, Card Transactions, Issuing Demand Drafts / Bank Guarantee, annual fees for opening DEMAT account etc. [Base Year 2011] Inflation Expectation Survey for households RBI quarterly survey of ~5k households across 18 cities, asking them what is their ‘expected level’ of inflation for the next 3 months and 1 year. RESIDEX by National Housing Bank (NHB) Measures inflation in the residential house prices in selected Indian cities. NHB changed base year from 2012 to 2017. NHB introduced new indices to measure inflation in Land Price, Building Materials & Housing Rental. INFLATION OBSERVATIONS BY ES-2020 The World bank observed that Inflation has decreased across developing nations from (119%) 1993 to 4.8% in 2018 because of: Monetary and fiscal policy Structural reforms to raise production. However, inflation is on the rise in India in 2019. Before 2018 CPI (Urban) << CPI (Rural). But since 2018: CPI (Urban) >> Rural due to higher level of food inflation 2018-19 Some areas have witnessed higher levels of inflation than the all India average. Example: Lakshadweep Andaman (geographical isolation), Manipur (frequent highway Bandh/blockades), Kerala (floods) etc. Thalinomics byES-2020 Thalinomics is a concept to estimate how much ₹₹ a common person pays for a Thali (platter of food) across India. Between 2015 to 2018, the Thali price has reduced: Across all regions of India For both veg and non-veg thalis. While Thali prices decreased between 2015-18, they have increased in 2019. But allover, thali’s affordability has increased for poor families. Consequently, a family of five people is able to save >₹10,000/per year because of reduced prices. ES-2020 appreciated various schemes of current government . for: Increasing food production and Making food more affordable. Index of Industrial Production (IIP) IIP is a monthly index prepared by CSO, for the base year 2011 and Laspeyres Index Formula. IIP measures production of 407 item groups related to Primary Goods: directly obtained from natural sources Example: Ores, Minerals, Crude Oil; And energy goods such as Petrol, Diesel, Electricity (Both Renewable and Non-Renewable Capital Goods: Plants & machinery used for further productio n Example: Boilers, Air & Gas Compressors, Engines, Transformers, Commercial Vehicles etc Infrastructure/construction Goods: Paints,cement, cables, bricks and tiles, rail materials, etc. Intermediate Goods: Which goes as input in production Example: Cotton yarn, Plywood, Steel Tubes/ Pipes, Fasteners, etc. Consumer Durables: Products directly used by consumers and having a longer durability (2 years or more). Example: Pressure Cooker, TV, AC, Tyres, Telephone , Mobile, Cars, Motorcycles, Scooters, Jewellery etc Consumer Non-durables: Products that are directly used by consumers and can’t be preserved for long periods. Example: Soyabean Oil, Milk Powder, Maida, Rice, Biscuits, Sugar, Tea, Cigarettes etc. Sector Weight% Item groups Mining 14.373 1 Manufacturing 77.633 405 Electricity 7.994 1 Total 100 407 Observations of ES2020 on IIP Compared to 2017, there has been a fall in IIP for 2018 and 2019 because: NPA problem, IL&FS-NBFC crisis – contracted amount of Loans moving toward the MSME Protectionism in US/EU levying higher import taxes on Indian products → decreased demand of Indian goods in foreign markets → decreased Indian production. Persistent decreasing demand in automobile, real estate sector → steel, cement production. Coal production decreases because of Excessive rainfall during monsoon, labour strike in mining States in 2019. Trade war – Between China and USA impacted IIP in India. Index of Eight Core Industries Prepared by EA-DPIIT, Base Year 2011, It’s similar to IIP index, focusing 8 core industries Descending order of weight à Refinery Products > Electricity> Steel> Coal> Crude Oil> Natural Gas> Cement>Fertilizers. Collectively, these 8 industries command 40.27% of the overall IIP. Q.

Find correct statement(s):______(CSE-2013) Inflation benefits the debtors. Inflation benefits the bondholders. Choose the correct option: A only B only Both A and B Neither A nor B INDICATORS – UNEMPLOYMENT Unemployment refers to a situation where a person of working age who is looking for work is unable to find employment. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, for someone to be termed as unemployed, they have to meet these three conditions: They do not have any job, not even a temporary or part-time job. They are currently available for work. They have actively searched for a job in the past four weeks. According to BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics), people who have stopped looking for work are not regarded as unemployed. They are not even counted as part of the labor force. If, for example, an unemployed person wins some money through the lottery and stops looking for work as they enjoy their new found wealth, that person is not considered as unemployed. Sustainable Development Goal – 8 Voluntary Unemployment: A person is out of a job of his own choice. Either he wants higher wages or doesn’t want to work at all. Voluntary unemployment is likely to occur when the equilibrium wage rate is below the wage necessary to encourage individuals to supply their labour. Involuntary Unemployment: Prevailing wage rates, but unable to find work due to factors beyond his control. TYPES OF INVOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT Types Features Cyclical Economy goes through boom-bust cycles. During bust / recession / depression when workers are laid off on a mass scale. Cyclical unemployment exists when individuals lose their jobs as a result of a downturn in aggregate demand (Total demand). If the decline in aggregate demand is persistent, and the unemployment long-term, it is called either Demand Deficient Unemployment in general, or Keynesian unemployment. E.g. Maruti removed 3000 workers in 2019-Aug because car sales are dipping. Frictional Frictional unemployment, also called search unemployment, occurs when workers lose their current job and are in the process of finding another one. There may be little that can be done to reduce this type of unemployment, other than provide better information to reduce the search time. This suggests that zero unemployment is impossible at any one time because some workers will always be in the process of changing jobs. Disguised Unemployment It is a form of unemployment where it may seem that some people are employed, when in fact they are not. Also referred as hidden unempl-oyment Common in developing countries where increasing populations result in a surplus in the labor force, where employees are working in a redundant manner. E.g. Farming family of 6 persons produces 400 kgs of wheat, but even if you remove 3 persons, production remains at 400 kgs of wheat. Seasonal Labourers in Agriculture, Salt-pans, Sugar Mills, Ice- factory, Tourist spots, Marriage Catering-Orchestra etc. Under employment Educated Unemployment Person is employed but not in a befitting position or salary corresponding to his qualification. e.g. M.Com working as peon in MNCs, M. Tech working as Bank clerk etc. Technological Unemployment Technological unemployment occurs when men are replaced with machines e.g. Textile / Automobile. 2018-Sept: World Economic Forum released “Future of Jobs Report”. It says, by 2025, machines will do more work hours than humans in 12 industrial sectors. As a result, 75 million worker jobs may be lost, but 133 million new jobs may emerge in robot repair/robot software design etc. Hence urgently workers need to be reskilled. Open / Structural Unemployment Structural unemployment occurs when certain industries decline because of long term changes in market conditions creating a mismatch between the skills needed by employers and the skills that workers possess. Lack of jobs when person’s skill/qualification is insufficient for the jobs available in the market Example: An IT Graduate knows machine design but demand is for Catia pro experts. Q. Disguised unemployment generally means_____ (CSE-2013) large number of people remain unemployed alternative employment is not available marginal productivity of labour is zero productivity of workers is low OTHER TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT Classical Unemployment Also referred to as induced unemployment or real wage unemployment. Caused when wages are ‘too’ high. Occurs in situations where wages are higher than the laws of supply and demand, forcing companies to lay off the other employees. It is caused by one of the following situations: Powerful trade unions negotiate for salaries and benefits that are above the market equilibrium. legal minimum wages are higher than the market equilibrium. Wages set by long term contracts exceed the equilibrium due to recession, forcing a company to lay off some workers. This explanation of unemployment dominated economic theory before the 1930s, when workers themselves were blamed for not accepting lower wages, or for asking for too high a wage. Regional Unemployment When structural unemployment affects local areas of an economy, it is called ‘regional’ unemployment. Labour market immobility is that it can create regional unemployment, which is a type of structural unemployment. Natural Unemployment Natural unemployment is defined as the lowest rate of unemployment that an economy can support. It can be considered as a baseline below which the levels of unemployment cannot decline. So, an economy that has reached this point is said to be at full employment. It is termed as ‘natural’ because it is caused by other factors that are independent of the state of the economy. Natural unemployment may be due to frictional, structural or classical unemployment. No economic or market fix can be made to eliminate natural unemployment. Economists consider a natural unemployment rate of around 4% to be an indicator of a healthy economy. STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR MOBILITY Labour immobility is likely to increase structural un-employment. This is because those industries that are growing and need labour, often called sunrise industries, are not necessarily able to employ the same workers who have been displaced in the declining, sunset industries. There are three types of labour immobility: Geographical immobility Industrial immobility Occupational immobility Information failure also contributes to labour immobility because workers may be immobile because they do not know where all the suitable jobs for them are. Geographical Immobility Occurs when workers are not willing or able to move from region to region, or town to town. Other factors such as strong social and family ties, and parents being unwilling to disrupt their children’s education by changing schools, immense house price variation Occupational Immobility Occupational immobility occurs when workers find it difficult to change jobs within an industry. Example: It may be very difficult for a doctor to retrain to be a dentist. Industrial immobility Industrial immobility occurs when workers do not move between industries, such as moving from employment in the motor industry to employment in the insurance industry. REASONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT Economic Slowdown: Currently, sectors like auto, real estate, banking, construction, agriculture and MSMEs – which contribute a considerable amount towards India’s GDP – are facing a sharp demand slowdown. Preference of Voluntary Unemployment: Voluntary unemployment is preferred over low-paying jobs (i.e. adopting the ‘wait-and-watch’ policy for the right job profile and remuneration. Downgrading of Employment: i.e. hiring of candidates, with higher but superfluous qualifications, for elementary positions (e.g. news reports of PhD holders applying for peon vacancies) Lack of Industry: Academia Cohesion: Disparity between colleges’/universities’ curriculums and industry requirements/ expectations. Lack of Vocational Training: which renders many unemployable Government Steps for employment generation MUDRA Bank Micro Units Development Refinance Agency (MUDRA) Bank Start Up India and Stand Up India Schemes Make in India Program profile and remuneration. The apparel and garments sector received a special package Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) WORKERS CLASSIFICATION BY NSO Self-employed · Those who work for themselves & charge ‘fees’. They do not sell their labour power to anyone else for a “wage”, so they are their own ‘boss’. · Subcategories: 1) Own Account 2) Partners / Owners / Employers Of Business Firm 3) Unpaid Family Labourers Regular Wage/Salaried employees They sell their labour to employers, for predetermined wages/salary. Their job continues round the year. Casual Workers They sell labour for ‘wage’ but employer hires them for very short time period on daily or monthly basis. Table 2: Number of workers in each category in PLFS: 2017-18 High to low 1 2 3 4 5 (Male, Female Combined) Own account workers Casual workers salaried employees Unpaid family labourer. 2% Employer (those who give jobs to others) Male Only Same descending order as above. Female Only Unpaid family labourers Casual worker salaried employee Own account workers 0.5% Employer within female labourers Census-2011 classification of workers Worker Type Employed for this much duration in a year Main Worker 6 months or more. (183 days to be precise) Marginal Worker Less than 6 months. Unemployment And Unorganized Sector An unorganized sector firm is not registered under any law such as Shop Establishment Act, Factory Act, Companies Act, Statutory Corporation, Govt org etc. Unorganized sector consists of individuals / self-employed workers engaged in non- trade-unionized casual / seasonal work with irregular payments & lack of social security coverage like EPFO/ESIC. Government has enacted Unorganized Sector Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 to provide them with life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits, old age protection etc. Indicative Examples of Unorganized worker Occupation Wise Small and marginal farmers, landless agricultural labourers, sharecroppers, fishermen, those engaged in animal husbandry, beedi rolling, labelling and packing, building and construction workers, leather workers, weavers, artisans, salt workers, brick kilns and stone quarries Nature of Employment Attached agricultural labourers, bonded labourers, migrant workers, contract and casual labourers. Specially Distressed Categories Toddy tappers, Scavengers, Carriers of head loads, Drivers of animal driven vehicles, Loaders and unloaders. Service Categories Midwives, Domestic workers, Fishermen and women, Barbers, Vegetable and fruit vendors, Newspaper vendors etc. Miscellaneous Cobblers, Hamals, Handicraft artisans, Handloom weavers, Lady tailors, Physically handicapped self-employed persons, Rickshaw pullers, Auto drivers, Carpenters, Tannery /Power loom workers and Urban poor. Unorganized Worker Unorganized worker is a Person working in the above sectors. There are more workers in the unorganized sector, than in the organized sector. Informal Worker Informal worker is a Person who is not in the formal records / contract of a firm. So he could be in the unorganized sector and he could be even in an ‘organized sector’ Example: driver / Security Guard/ gardener, delivery boy of Zomato etc. Table: Number of workers in each category in PLFS: 2017-18 Approx.. Amt in cr Organized Unorganized = Total Formal 4.4 0.3 4.7 Informal 4.6 37.7 42 = Total 9 38 47cr NSO SURVEYS NSO Surveys Quinquennial Employment and Unemployment Surveys Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) Frequency of Survey Every 5 years. Starting from 1972 Last survey was done in 2011-12. Then discontinued Annual, Started since 2017 2017 result announced in 2019. Households Which are Surveyed by NSO Non-agricultural workers in rural and urban areas 75% of the surveyed houses should have a minimum one class10 pass person. Both urban & rural, agro & non-agro covered. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (UR) Labour force Those who are ‘working’ (or employed) and those ‘seeking or available for work’ (may be called as involuntarily unemployed). Unemployment rate finds involuntarily unemployed persons via following formula: Current Weekly Status If not employed even 1 hr work in a week Current Daily Status If not employed even 1 hr work in a day in a given week. Usual Status (US) It’s further subdivided into: Principal Activity Status (PS) Subsidiary Economic Activity Status (SS) If a person’s usual status (PP+SS) was “Unemployed” for the majority of the year →he is deemed unemployed. In official reports, this figure is given more prominence. 2019-Jun: NSSO’s periodic labour force survey (PLFS) says unemployment rate is 6.1% as per (USPS+SS: 2017) which is the highest in the last 45 years. ** WORKER POPULATION RATIO (WPR) It is the percentage of employed persons in the population. Indicative Examples of Unorganized worker LFPR is the percentage of a person in the labour force (i.e. working or seeking or available for work) in the population. 2017–37% (male + female in rural + urban combined). It can’t be 100% because there will be children, elderly outside the ‘15-59’ age group meant for workers. ES20 observed between 2004 to 2017, LFPR (Female: rural+urban) steadily decreasing because: More and more of the proportion of women pursuing higher studies → their entry in the job market is delayed. Rising income of (some) rural men → their wives have stopped working as labourer and just playing domestic housewives. Increased mechanization of agriculture & animal husbandry → Drop in demand for female agricultural workers. Drop in textile/leather exports due to US/EU protectionism → decrease in demand for female workers Drop in real estate sales → decreased construction of new buildings →drop in female laborers Cultural factors, social constraints and patriarchal norms restricting mobility and freedom of women. Many rural / small-town girls don’t require knowledge of computers and English to get jobs in the emerging Startup sector. Prudential solutions will be government schemes for skill development and entrepreneurship among women. UNEMPLOYMENT DATA Household Surveys: Example: Employment-Unemployment Survey (NSSO), Annual Labour Force Survey (Labour Bureau) Enterprise Surveys: Example: Economic Census (by MOSPI), Annual Survey of Industries (MoSPI), Unorganized Sector Surveys of Industries and Services (NSSO), Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) (Labour Bureau) Social Security Schemes: Example: Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Administrative Data: It includes tax returns and filings, pension and medical insurance programs Data from Government Schemes: It includes estimates via MGNREGA, MUDRA, job creations under programs such as ICDS, PMKVY, DDUGKY etc. Emerging Sources: GSTN, Big Data analytics URBAN EMPLOYMENT India is in the midst of a massive job’s crisis. The unemployment rate has reached a 45-year high (6.1%) in 2017-18 as per data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). According to the PLFS report, the unemployment problem is especially aggravated in India’s cities and towns. Aside from unemployment, low wages and precarity continue to be widespread. Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University, recently published a policy brief “Strengthening Towns through Sustainable Employment”, which proposes the creation of a National Urban Employment Guarantee Programme. Idea of an urban employment programm The idea of an urban employment programm is gaining traction in political and policy debates. In Madhya Pradesh, the State government has launched the “Yuva Swabhiman Yojana” which provides employment for both skilled and unskilled workers among urban youth. Green New Deal: In the United States of America, ‘Green New Deal’ proposals provide for a ‘Green Job Guarantee’ which enshrines ‘a legal right that obligates the federal government to provide a job for anyone who asks for one and to pay them a liveable wage’. Given the State’s relative neglect of small and medium towns and to avoid migration to big cities, such a programme can cover all ULBs with a population less than 1 million. In the context of the present employment crises, it is worthwhile considering introducing an employment guarantee programme in urban areas. Conclusion An urban employment guarantee programme not only improves incomes of workers but also has multiplier effects on the economy. It will boost local demand in small towns, improve public infrastructure and services, spur entrepreneurship, build skills of workers and create a shared sense of public goods. Hence, the time is ripe for an employment guarantee programme in urban India. Hence we need new ways to promote the sustainable development of India’s small and medium towns. WAYS TO CREATE JOBS Shift development focuses towards labour intensive sectors to create more jobs, such as food processing, leather and footwear, wood manufacturers and furniture, textiles and apparel and garments. Cluster development to support job creation in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), with a specific focus on incentivizing these MSMEs to grow bigger to generate more jobs. Formalisation of Workforce: Where growth in jobs must be inclusive and new jobs need to be decent and secure with better work conditions including social security benefits and the right to organise. Expansion of the organized sector to create well-paid high productivity jobs. Greater focus is required on better and relevant skilling opportunities so as to compete with neighbours and global competitors. Expansion in the export market by developing Coastal Employment Zones (CEZ), using better technology, and improving on quality to remain competitive. Incentivizing Industry: Reducing corporate tax, easing lending norms and relaxing GST rules on a short-term basis are some of the reforms that could give companies more room for hiring and boosting productivity. The public invests in health, education, police and judiciary to create many government jobs. The government should introduce reforms to quell the wage gap and get more women to become a part of the country’s workforce. India will have to shed its service-led structure and transform into an innovation-driven economy and focus on becoming a creator rather than an adopter. Skilling and Apprenticeship is the Need of the Hour Another novel aspect is the creation of a skilling and apprenticeship programme for unemployed youth with higher education who can sign up for a contiguous period of 150 days (five months), at Rs.13,000 a month for five months. These employed workers can assist with administrative functions in municipal offices, government schools, or public health centres, and for the monitoring, measurement, or evaluation of environmental parameters. Conclusion Economic indicators provide crucial insights into India’s economic performance and challenges. Despite difficulties in estimation and the limitations of traditional measures, these indicators guide policy decisions and strategic planning. India’s efforts towards post-COVID-19 recovery, tackling declining growth rates, and enhancing employment generation are pivotal. The focus on economic development, rather than just growth, along with strategic initiatives, will be essential for achieving long-term stability and prosperity. Understanding and utilizing these economic indicators will be key to navigating the path towards a resilient and thriving economy.

    "chapter_name": "INCLUSIVE GROWTH",
    "content": "Inclusive Growth: Definition, Strategies, Policy & Challenges Introduction to Inclusive Growth To prepare for INDIAN ECONOMY for any competitive exam, aspirants have to know about Inclusive Growth. It gives an idea of all the important topics for the IAS Exam and the Economy syllabus (GS-II). Important Inclusive Growth terms are important from Economy perspectives in the UPSC exam. IAS aspirants should thoroughly understand their meaning and application, as questions can be asked from this static portion of the IAS Syllabus in both the UPSC Prelims and the UPSC Mains exams. “ Inclusive Growth refers both to the pace and pattern of growth, which are interlinked and must be addressed together. ” — World Bank Inclusive growth entails comprehensive growth, shared growth, and pro-poor growth. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course In a broad sense, Inclusive Growth implies the inclusion of all sections of society in the process of economic development and the sharing of its benefits. Therefore, IG is not only an outcome or end but also a process or a means in itself. According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), inclusive growth is “the process and the outcome where all groups of people have participated in the organization of growth and have benefited equitably from it”. This implies that inclusive growth should include all sections as beneficiaries as well as partners in growth and that inclusion of the excluded should be embedded in the growth process. Inclusive growth is also defined in terms of reduction in inequalities in incomes, assets as well as in vertical inequalities (individual inequalities) and horizontal inequalities (group inequalities). Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Inclusive Growth in India: Key Features for Sustainable Development Address the constraints of the excluded and marginalized. Participation from all sections of society Reduction in disparities among per capita incomes between: Different sectors of economy Different Sections of society Rural And Urban Areas Different genders Non – discriminatory Higher potential of poverty reduction Ensure access of people to basic infrastructure and basic services/capabilities such as basic health and education. This access should include not only the quantity, but also quality of these basic services. Include poor, lagging socio – economic groups and lagging regions as well as they are partners in this growth. Broader components of Inclusive growth Equitable distribution of income Social Sector Development Reduction in regional disparities Protecting the environment Industrial Development Agriculture Development Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Why Inclusive Growth Matters for India’s Future Development? There is a severe lack of accessibility to core public services. Public spending across core services stays at a dismal percentage of GDP (1 – 2%). Though institutions have been erected but quality is uneven. Malnutrition and undernourishment have been prevalent in society among marginalized sections, especially among adolescent girls. Economic and Social inequalities exist at intra-state and inter-state level. Poor growth rates and poor public services in lagging states make sure that disparity increases. The data is reflected in the Human Development Index and Per Capita Income across different states. Low agriculture growth, low quality employment growth, low human development, rural-urban divides, gender and social inequalities, and regional disparities etc. are the problems for the nation Reducing poverty and inequality and increasing economic growth are the main aims of the country through inclusive growth. Growth has been uneven across sectors and locations. For instance, agriculture has been lagging behind and in countries such as India and China, some regions have advanced faster than others. Policies are also relatively ignored in the agriculture sector. Due to trade competitiveness, foreign direct investment and new technologies have demanded skilled labor. In some cases, labor laws also often discriminate against formal employment and encourage ‘casualization’ of labor . Unsustainable economic growth. Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Essential Elements of Inclusive Growth in India: Inclusive growth is a multi-dimensional concept that facilitates inclusion from a variety of fronts that include: Skill Development: Harnessing the demographic dividend will depend upon the employability of the working age population, their health, education, vocational training and skills. Skill development plays a key role here. India is facing a dual challenge in skill development: First, there is a paucity of highly trained workforce Second, there is non-employment of conventionally trained youths According to the Economic Survey 2017, over 30% of youth in India are NEET (Not in education, employment or training). Financial Inclusion: Financial Inclusion is the process of ensuring access to financial services to vulnerable groups at affordable costs. Financial inclusion is necessary for inclusive growth as it leads to a culture of saving , which initiates a virtuous cycle of economic development. Technological Advancement: The world is moving towards an era of Industrial Revolution 4.0. These technological advancements have capabilities to both decrease and increase inequality, depending on the way these are being used. Several initiatives have been taken by the government, e.g. Digital India Mission , so that a digitally literate population can leverage technology for endless possibilities. Technology can help to combat other challenges too. Economic Growth: India is among the fastest-growing major economies in the world. However, currently the Indian economy is facing slowdown due to both cyclic and structural challenges . However, the target of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 can allow India to reduce inequality, increase social expenditure and provide employment to all. Social Development: It means the empowerment of all marginalized sections of the population like SC/ST/OBC/Minorities, women and transgenders. Empowerment can be done by improving institutions of the social structure i.e. hospitals especially primary care in the rural areas , schools , universities , etc. Investment in social structures will not only boost growth (by fiscal stimulus) but will also create a healthy and capable generation to handle future work.

These three scenarios are “ Strong inclusive growth ”, “ Insufficient action ” and “ Policy Logjam ”. The first one viz. Strong inclusive growth is the most optimistic one but needs effective implementation and a robust government. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching The plan document discusses the following aspects of inclusiveness: Inclusiveness as Poverty Reduction: So that adequate flow of benefits to the poor and the most marginalized. Inclusiveness as Group Equality: The poor are certainly one target group, but inclusiveness must also embrace the concern of other groups such as the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Minorities, women, the differently abled and other marginalized groups. Inclusiveness as Regional Balance: This aspect of inclusiveness relates to whether all States, and indeed all regions, are seen to benefit from the growth process. Improvement in infrastructure must therefore be an important component of any regionally inclusive development strategy. Inclusiveness as Reducing Inequality: There is a need to keep inequality into tolerable limits. Inclusiveness as Empowerment: The Plan document says that inclusiveness is not just about ensuring a broad-based flow of benefits or economic opportunities; it is also about empowerment and participation. Inclusiveness through Employment Programmes: The document stresses on the quality of assets created, which will determine whether MGNREGA can go beyond the safety net to become a springboard for entrepreneurship, even at the lowest income levels. Components of Inclusive Growth – 11th 5 year Plan Access to essential services Employment Generation Women empowerment Good governance Skill building Equality of opportunity Poverty Reduction Enroll now for UPSC Online Course NITI Aayog’s Blueprint for Inclusive Growth in India New India @75 vision has the following objectives for the inclusive growth: To have a rapid growth, which reaches 9-10% by 2022-23, which is inclusive, clean, sustained and formalized. To Leverage technology for inclusive, sustainable and participatory development by 2022-23. To have an inclusive development in the cities to ensure that urban poor and slum dwellers including recent migrants can avail city services. To make schools more inclusive by addressing the barriers related to the physical environment (e.g. accessible toilets), admission procedures as well as curriculum design. To make higher education more inclusive for the most vulnerable groups. To provide quality ambulatory services for an inclusive package of diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care, close to the people. To prepare an inclusive policy framework with citizens at the center.

Poor nutritional, health and educational indicators Agriculture Backwardness Issues with Social Development Regional Disparities Inadequate infrastructure Social inequality and discrimination India’s Journey Towards Inclusive Growth By the 12th five year plan the focus increased when the slogan was designed as “Faster, sustainable and More inclusive growth”. The government evolved a clear short term and long-term policy towards the cause of inclusive growth. Short Term Policy: It aimed at supplying those goods and services to the disadvantaged and marginalized sections of the society which are bare minimum and essential in nature. Sponsored schemes are run by the governments for this purpose. The following areas are touched by this policy: Food and Nutrition: Annapurna, Antyodaya, Mid-Day Meal, National food security act etc. Healthcare and Sanitation: National health mission, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, ASHA, Mission Indradhanush etc Housing: Indira Awas Yojana, Rajiv Awas yojana etc Drinking Water: National rural drinking water programme etc. Education: Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan etc. Long Term Policy: This is aimed at bringing in self dependence in the target population. An element of sustainability is present in it. The attempts by the government are classified as: All the schemes which aim at poverty alleviation and employment generation All the programmes which promote education at any level Vocationalisation of education Skill development Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching The strategy for inclusive growth in 11th and 12th five year plans aims at achieving the objectives of sustainability and inclusiveness. The strategy emphasized that GDP is not an end in itself but the means to an end. India is committed to securing inclusive growth, leading to sustainable development and to usher in a governance of transparency and accountability. India believes that poverty eradication and job creation are primary objectives to achieve inclusive growth under the ambit of Sustainable Development Goals in United Nations Framework. Inclusive Growth Initiatives: Schemes Shaping India’s Development Financial Inclusion: Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana Atal Pension Yojana Pradhan mantri mudra yojana Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM Trinity) Employment and inclusive growth: MGNREGA Skill Training for Employment Promotion amongst Urban Poor (STEP-UP) Swaran Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojna Agriculture and inclusive growth: Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana National Agriculture market National Food Security Act Technology and inclusive growth: Digital India Program: Skill development and inclusive growth: National skill development mission: Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) Pradhan Mantri Vidya Lakshmi Karyakram Self- Employment and Talent Utilisation (SETU) mechanism. Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) Enroll now for UPSC Online Course Concerns with Inclusive Growth Schemes in India: Challenges in Food Security and Malnutrition: Despite the high and fast growing emerging market economy, India has some shocking statistics when it comes to food security. As per the recent UNICEF report , at least one million children under five die in India due to malnutrition related issues. Here, the burden among the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward castes and rural communities is highest in terms of acute malnutrition. Among the states, it is Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan that have acute problems in terms of malnutrition. Recognizing the Vital Role of Social Enterprises: Social enterprises can play a key role in India’s agenda of inclusive developments. However, just like in many other countries, they are not officially or legally recognised as a sector in India, even while they play an important part in the fight against poverty. Barriers to Achieving Inclusive Growth: The main reasons for India’s failure to achieve inclusive growth and distributive justice are: The failure of land reform The wrecking of the well-designed community development programme that aimed at the all-round development of the village The lack of success in providing adequate employment opportunities at living wages to a rising population The neglect of school education and the absence of special measures designed to help children of the poor to get a good school education. Continued dependence of some 60 percent of the workforce on low-productivity agriculture and allied occupations for employment and living. Enroll now for UPSC Online Classes Promoting Inclusive Growth: World Economic Forum’s Insights on Social Inclusion and Economic Growth Investing in Citizens’ Capabilities: First, countries should increase public and private investment in their citizens’ capabilities, which is the most important way they can durably lift their rate of productivity growth. Upgrading Work Rules and Institutions: Second, governments, together with employers’ and workers’ organizations, should upgrade national rules and institutions relating to work. These influence the quantity and distribution of job opportunities and compensation, and thus the level of purchasing power and aggregate demand within the economy. Investing in Labor-Intensive Sectors: Third, countries should increase public and private investment in labor-intensive economic sectors that generate wider benefits for society. These include sustainable water, energy, digital, and transport infrastructure, care sectors, the rural economy, and education and training. Way Forward: Enhancing Education and Skill Development: With the onset of the IT revolution it has become obligatory for new entrants to acquire even higher levels of skills. Hence it is a matter of urgency to provide adequate facilities for quality school education and impart relevant skills to the disadvantaged. Improving Schools and Teacher Training: The working of existing government schools should be improved as a matter of priority. Hence the need to improve the functioning of government schools without losing more time. There is also a need to expand and modernize teacher-training facilities. Promoting Labor-Intensive and Inclusive Economic Growth: It is also important that growth in developing economies continues to remain more labor- intensive and broad-based, as a generation of production employment opportunities on a large scale is perhaps the best way for including the excluded and marginalized sections of the population. Agricultural: research needs to be greatly strengthened both in terms of the resources devoted to it and also by implementing institutional reform along the lines recommended by the Mashelkar Committee and the Swaminathan Committee. Taxation: More progressive tax system in India would help raise capital for expenditure on infrastructure, healthcare, basic services and education. Rights-Based Approach: It is critical to adopt a rights-based approach accepting the citizenship’s rights of people. Provision of education, healthcare, basic infrastructural needs are part of the basic rights of every citizen. A persistent increase in social investments such as education and healthcare are attached with long-term benefits and are part of a macro strategy for improving productivity of workers and for enhancing aggregate effective demand in the economy. Gram Sabha for Inclusive Growth should be empowered and made effective especially in tribal areas and as per FRA their consent should be made mandatory of mining lease. Enroll now for UPSC Online Coaching Conclusion Inclusive growth is crucial for India’s development, ensuring everyone benefits from economic progress. Despite challenges like poverty and inequality, government initiatives aim to empower marginalized communities through education, employment, and social welfare schemes. By focusing on skill development, financial inclusion, and equitable opportunities, India can achieve sustainable and inclusive growth for all."
