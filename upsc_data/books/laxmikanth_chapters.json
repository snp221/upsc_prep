    "chapter": "Public Interest Litigation",
    "content": "Introduction. Developed in USA in 1960s to give legal representation to the poor, environmentalists, consumers, racial & ethnic minorities, and others. In India, PIL is a product of Judicial Activism in early 1980s. PIL in India was facilitated due to relaxation of rule of ‘locus standi’ (only whose rights are violated can move the court). PIL can be filed by any person having sufficient interest on behalf of those whose rights are being violated and cannot approach the court themselves. Purpose of PIL includes : Vindication of Rule of Law. Providing effective access to justice to socially & economically weaker sections of the society. Meaningful realisation of the Fundamental Rights. Scope of PIL. According to SC’s guidelines, PIL can be filed only on following matters : Bonded Labour matters / Neglected Children / non-payment of wages and Exploitation of workers / Petitions from jail complaining of harassment or for early release, death in jail, transfer, release on personal bond, speedy trial as Fund. Rt / Petitions against police for refusing to register FIR, harassment, & death in custody / Petitions against atrocities on women, harassment of bride, rape murder, kidnapping / Petitions complaining of harassment or torture of SC/ST/OBC villagers by Co-villagers or police / Petitions relating to environmental pollution, drugs, food adulteration, maintenance of heritage and culture, forest and wildlife, other matters of public importance / Petitions from riot victims / Family pension. Principles of PIL. PILs are admitted by SC & HCs in fulfilling their duties under Art 32 & 226. Ordinary Procedural laws are relaxed in order to admit PILs. The Court can invoke Art 14, 21 & Human Rts to protect Rts of people. Common rule of ‘locus standi’ is relaxed to allow representation of poor. If prima facie, PIL shows valid reasons, State may not be allowed by the Court to raise any questions on maintainability of the petition. Dispute between warring groups in realm of private law can not be PIL. However, in appropriate cases, the Court may further enquire into the subject of litigation in public interest, even if the orognal petition was moved for redressal of personal grievance only. Court may appoint investigative Commissions & bodies to enquire into PILs. Court will not transgress into policy & remain within jurisdiction. HC may pass an order to protect Rts but not excercise powers akin to Ar 142."

    "chapter": "Judicial Activism",
    "content": "Introduction. Originated in the USA. Judicial Activism means the proactive role that the judiciary plays to protect the rights of citizens by forcing the other 2 organs of the government to do their Constitutional duty. Judicial Activism can lead sometimes lead to the judiciary overstepping their powers to intrude into Legislative and executive functions and powers. PIL is the most popular form and tool for Judicial Activism. Justification of Judicial Activism. When legislature & Executive fail to do their duties it can lead to collapse of responsible governance. Citizens of the country look up to judiciary to protect their rights & freedoms. This forces judiciary to act to fulfill the needs of the masses. To fill in laws for matters on which no clear legislation exists. To make the difficult and unpopular decisions for greater good when the political parties are not able to do the same durme to fear of losing power. When the basic rights of citizens are not being fulfilled because of lacklustre attitude of the people in power. Activators of Judicial Activism. Civil Rights Activists : focusing on civil & political rights issues. People Rights Activists : working against Government suppression of rights. Consumer Rights groups : raise issues of consumer rights. Citizens for environmental action. Bonded Labour. Rights of Child groups. Custodial Rights Groups : rights for those in prison or police custody. Poverty Rights Groups. Indigenous People’s Rights Groups : rights for tribals and forest dwellers. Women’s Rights Groups. Bar-based Groups : Autonomy & accountability of Indian Judiciary. Media Autonomy Groups. Assorted Lawyer-based Groups : Includes influential lawyers for causes. Assorted individual Petitioners : includes freelance activist individuals. Judicial Restraint. Means that the roles of judges should be limited to saying what the law is and leaving the business of law-making to the legislature & Executive. Supreme Court while delivering a judgement in 2007 called for Judicial Restraint. It said : Judges unjustifiably trying to perform exec or leg functions is unconst. Judges must not overreach and encroach on the domains of other two organs of the government. Courts must realise that administrative authorities are experts in their field while the court is not an administration expert. Other 2 organs not doing their jobs is not reason valid enough since judiciary is also not doing its job of clearing the pending cases. People have the right to correct their Govt by voting, not the judiciary. Encroachment of power will lead to imbalance of power between the organs of the Govt which may lead to similar retaliation from them."

    "chapter": "Judicial Review",
    "content": "Introduction. Judicial Review is the power of the judiciary (SC & HC) to examine the Constitutional validity of Legislative enactments and executive orders of the Centre & State governments.

SC has declared Judicial Review as part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Constitutional Provisions for Judicial Review. ‘Judicial Review’ not mentioned in the Constitution. Article 13 declares all laws inconsistent with Fund. Rts. shall be void. This provides for clear grounds for Judicial Review by the Court through interpretation of the Constitution. Article 32 gives the Right to Constitutional Remedies for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights and review of laws or exec acts which violate Rights. Article 226 empowers HCs to issue writs for protection of Fundamental Rights as well as for other matters. Scope of Judicial Review. The Constitutional validity of a Legislative enactment or an executive order can be challenged in the SC or HC on the following 3 grounds : It infringes the Fundamental Rights (Part-lll). It is outside the competence of the authority which has framed it. It is repugnant to the Constitutional provisions. Judicial Review of the 9th Schedule. 1st Const Amd introduced Article 31B which protected acts and regulations included in the 9th Schedule from being challenged on the grounds of violation of Fundamental Rights. In I.R. Coelho case (2007), SC ruled that a law placed in the 9th Schedule after April 24, 1973 cannot violate the Fundamental Rights under Article 14, 15,19 & 21 or the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. April 24,1973 was the founding day of the ‘basic structure’ concept through the verdict in the Kesavananda Bharati case."

Money Bills : which are concerned with financial matters like taxation, public expenditure, etc. Financial Bills : which are also concerned with financial matters but are different from money bills. Constitution Amendment Bills : which are concerned with the amendment of the provisions of the Constitution. Ordinary Bills. Every Ordinary Bill passes through following stages in Parliament : First Reading : Ordinary Bill can be introduced by any member in any House with the permission of the House. The Bill is introduced to the House by proposer and then is published in the Gazette of India. If Bill is published before introduction then leave of House is not necessary. No discussion of the Bill take place at this stage. Together the introduction of the Bill & its publication in the Gazette constitutes the First Reading. Second Reading : involves 3 sub-stages : Stage of General Discussion : Printed copies are distributed in House. Principles & Provs are discussed in general but not in detail. The House may take the Bill immediately for consideration OR refer the Bill to Select Committee or to Joint Committee OR may elicit public opinion. Committee Stage : The Select or Joint Committee examines the Bill thoroughly. It can amend the provisions without altering the basic principles. After this thorough scrutiny & amendment (if any), the Bill is sent back to House. Consideration Stage : The House discusses and votes on the Bill clause by clause. Amendments can also be moved & accepted at this stage. Third Reading : The debate is confined to only rejection or acceptance of Bill. The Rejection or Acceptance of Bill is considered as a whole. No amendments can be moved. If Majority of members present & Voting (Simple Majority) accept the Bill, the Bill is regarded to be passed by the House. The Bill is then authenticated by the Presiding Officer of the House and transmitted to the other House for consideration. An Ordinary Bill is deemed to be passed by the Parliament only when both the Houses of the Parliament pass the bill by a Simple Majority. Bill in the Second House : The Bill goes through the same three stages of First, Second & Third Reading in the second House as well. The House has four alternatives : May pass the Bill without amendments. May the Bill with amendments and send it to first house for reconsideration. May reject the Bill. May not take any action and thus keep the Bill pending. If both Houses pass the Bill then the Bill goes to President for his assent. If Second House rejects the Bill or passes Bill with amendments which are then rejected by the First House, or if House does not take action on Bill for 6 months, then a deadlock is deemed to have taken place. In case of deadlock, President summons both Houses for a Joint Sitting. If Majority of members in Joint Sitting of both Houses pass the Bill, then the Bill goes to Prez for her assent. Assent of the President : After every Bill is passed by the Parliament, the President has three alternatives : May give assent to the Bill. May withhold assent to the Bill. May return Bill for reconsideration. When assent is given, Bill becomes an Act or Law and is placed in the Statute Book. If President withholds assent (see Ch-17), then the Bill ends right there. If the Bill is sent for reconsideration and is passed for a second time with or without amendments by Both Houses, then the President’s Assent is mandatory. Money Bills. Art 110 defines money bills as those bills containing only provisions dealing with following matters : Imposition, Abolition, Remission, alteration or regulation of tax Regulation of the borrowing of money by the Union Government. Custody of Consolidated Fund of India or Contingency Fund of India or of withdrawal or deposition of money in such funds. Appropriation of money out of Consolidated Fund of India.

The Speaker’s decision on the question of whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not is final. It cannot be questioned in a court of law. Legislative Procedure for Money Bill. A Money Bill can be introduced only in Lok Sabha and that too with prior permission of President. A Money Bill cannot be introduced by a private member. After the Money Bill is passed by Lok Sabha, it is transmitted to Rajya Sabha. Rajya Sabha has restricted powers in respect to Money Bill : RS cannot reject or amend a Money Bill. It can only make recommendations. RS must return Bill with or without recommendations to LS within 14 days, failing which the Bill is deemed as passed by both Houses. When a Bill is returned to LS, it can reject all recommendations or accept them.

It can be rejected or amended in both Houses. Joint Sitting can be called in a deadlock. President can also give or withhold assent or return the Bill for reconsideration. Budget in Parliament. Introduction. Constitution refers to the budget as ‘Annual Financial Statement’. Term ‘budget’ is not mentioned. Art 112 deals with budget. Budget is a statement of estimated receipts & expenditure of the Govt in a financial year (1 April – 31 March) The budget contains the following : Estimates of revenue & capital receipts. Ways & means to raise the revenue. Estimates of expenditure. Details of actual receipts & expenditure of the closing financial year & reasons for any deficit or surplus in that year. Economic & Financial policy of the coming year – taxation proposals, prospects of revenue, spending programme & introduction of new schemes & projects. Charged Expenditure. The budget consists of two types of expenditure : expenditure ‘charged’ upon the Consolidated Fund of India and expenditure ‘made’ from the Consolidated Fund of India. Charged Expenditure is non-votable, it can only be discussed in Parliament. ‘Made’ Expenditure must be voted by the Parliament. List of Charged Expenditure : Salary & allowances of President, Chairman & Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Speaker & Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha, Judges of Supreme Court, Comptroller & Auditor-General, Chairman & members of UPSC.

Debt charges for which Govt of India is liable including interest, etc. Any sum required to satisfy a judgement of courts or tribunal. Any expenditure declared so by Parliament. Stages in Enactment of Budget. Presentation of Budget : Budget is presented by Finance Minister in Lok Sabha through a ‘budget speech’. At the end of Speech in LS, the Budget is laid before Rajya Sabha which can only discuss it & not vote on it. General Discussion : It generally begins a few days after presentation & lasts for 3 to 4 days. Whole budget can be discussed or any question of principle therein. No cut motion can be moved & budget cannot be voted on. Scrutiny by Departmental Committees : After General Discussion, both Houses are adjourned for 3 to 4 weeks. In this gap, 24 Departmental standing committees of Parliament examine & discuss in detail the demand for grants of concerned Ministries & prepare reports. These reports are submitted to the Houses for consideration. Voting on Demands for Grants : Demands for Grants are presented ministry-wise infornt of the Lok Sabha. A demand becomes a grant once duly voted on. General budget has 109 demands + 32 demands for Railway. Each demand is voted on individually. The budget is discussed in detail before vote and motions to reduce the demand (cut motions) can also be moved which are of 3 types : Policy Cut Motion : represents disapproval of policy underlying the demand. States that amount of demand be reduced to Rs 1. Economy Cut Motion : demand may be reduced by a specified amount. Token Cut Motion : represents a grievance. States that amount be reduced by Rs 100. A passing of cut motion will show the lack of majority of Govt and therefore may lead to its resignation. 26 days are allotted for discussion & Voting but on the last day all demands are put to vote whether discussed or not. This is called ‘guillotine’. Passing of Appropriation Bill : An appropriation bill is passed to sanction withdrawal from Consolidated Fund of India for all money required to meet the grants voted by the Lok Sabha & the Expenditure charged on CFI. Grants cannot be withdrawn without assent of Prez on the Appropriation Bill. This takes some time, therefore Lok Sabha has powers to make advance grants for the meantime. This is called ‘ Vote on Account ’. Passed after General Discussion is over. Generally provides for 2 months of expenditure. Passing of Finance Bill : The proposals of the government for levy of new taxes, modification of the existing tax structure or continuance of the existing tax structure beyond the period approved by Parliament are submitted to Parliament through this bill. Subjected to all conditions as a Money Bill. The President must give his assent within 75 days. Finance Act legalises the income side of the budget and completes the process of enactment of the budget. Grants in Parliament. In addition to the budget, which contains ordinary estimates of income and expenditure, various other grants are also made by Parliament under extraordinary or special circumstances : Supplementary Grants. Additional Grant. Excess Grant. Vote of Credit. Exceptional Grant. Token Grant. Supplementary Grant : Granted when the amount authorised by Parliament in the budget for a specific task is found to be insufficient.

Parliamentary Privileges are special rights, immunities and exemptions by the Houses of Parliament, their committees and members. Privileges exist in order to maintain authority, dignity and honour of the Parliament and to protect the members from obstruction in discharge of their parliamentary duties. Parliamentary Privileges extend to those persons who are entitled to take part and speak in the proceedings of the Houses or their committees, including Attorney General of India and Union Ministers. Not extended to the President. Can be classified into two types : Collective Privileges. Individual Privileges. Collective Privileges. These belong to the Houses as a whole : Right to publish its reports, debates and proceedings. Right to prohibit others from publishing the same. Press can publish true reports of Parliamentary Proceedings, except in case of secret sitting. Right to hold secret meetings by excluding non-members from House. Right to make its own of rules of Procedure and conduct. Right to punish members as well as outsiders for breach of its privileges or for its contempt, by reprimand, admonition or imprisonment (also suspension or expulsion, in case of members). Right to receive immediate information of arrest, detention, conviction, imprisonment & release of members. Can institute inquiries, order attendance of witnesses & gain relevant records and papers. No person can be arrested within the precincts of the House without permission of the Presiding officer. Courts are prohibited to inquire into proceedings of a House or its Committees. Individual Privileges. These are enjoyed by all members individually : They cannot be arrested only in civil cases – during the session of the Parliament, 40 days before the beginning and 40 days after the end of a session. Not applicable in criminal or Preventive Detention cases. They have freedom of speech in Parliament. No member is liable to any proceedings for anything said or any vote cast in the House or zits Committees subject to provisions of the Constitution and to the rules of Procedure of Parliament. They can refuse to give evidence and appear as a witness in a case pending in a court when the Parliament is in session. ***Constitution only mentions Freedom of Speech & right of publication as Parliamentary Privileges. It declared that other privileges would be the same as those of British House of Commons until determined otherwise by Parliament. Breach of Privilege & Contempt of House. When any individual or authority disregards or attacks any of the privileges, rights, immunities of the individual members or of the House in collective capacity, the offence is termed as ‘breach of privilege’. Any act or omission which obstructs a house of Parliament, its members or its officers in performance of their duties or which has a tendency to directly or indirectly hurt the dignity, authority and honour of the House is treated as a ‘contempt of House’. The two terms are used interchangeably, however a contempt of House can be committed without necessarily breaching any of the privileges of the House."

    "chapter": "Emergency Provisions",
    "content": "Introduction. Emergency Provisions – Part XVlll — Article 352 to 360. To protect Sovereignty, Unity, Integrity, Security of Country, Democratic Political System, & The Constitution. Centre becomes all powerful, Country takes Unitary Form. Unique to the Indian Constitution. Three types of Emergency : Art 352 : Due to war, external aggression or armed rebellion – National Emergency. ‘Proclamation of Emergency’ denotes this emergency only. Art 356 : Due to failure of Constitutional Machinery in a State – President’s Rule. Const. doesn’t use ‘emergency’ for this provision. Art 360 : Due to threat to financial stability or credit of India – Financial Emergency. National Emergency. Grounds of Declaration. Under Art 352, Prez can declare National Emergency on grounds of War, External Aggression or Armed Rebellion, or in anticipation of them. Prez can also issue separate proclamation of National Emergency on the same grounds, even if a National Emergency is already in effect (38th Amd). External Emergency – on grounds of War or external aggression. Internal Emergency – on grounds of Armed Rebellion. Emergency can be applicable to whole or part of India (42nd Amd, 1976). 44th Amd, 1978 replaced ‘internal disturbance’ with ‘armed rebellion’. National Emergency can be declared only on written recommendation of the Cabinet. It requires the concurrence of the Cabinet not just the PM. National Emergency can be challenged in the judiciary on the grounds of malafide, or that the declaration was based on wholly extraneous or irrelevant facts or is absurd or perverse. Parliamentary Approval & Duration. Both Houses must approve the emergency within 1 month of Declaration with a Special Majority. If Lok Sabha remained dissolved at the time of Declaration, only Rajya Sabha must approve within 1 month, Lok Sabha must approve with 30 days of its reconstitution. When approved by both Houses, Emergency lasts until 6 months at which point it must be reapproved through the same process. If Lok Sabha is dissolved before giving reapproval, then only Rajya Sabha has to give reapprove. Lok Sabha must reapprove within 30 days of reconstitution. 44th Amd, 1978 – replaced provision for approval by simple majority with special majority. It also provided for reapproval of emergency, before which the Executive had the power to continue emergency once approved for as long as they desired. Replaced 2 month approval period with 1 month. Revocation of proclamation. President can revoke emergency without approval of Parliament. Lok Sabha can also pass a resolution by Simple Majority directing the President to revoke the emergency. Such a resolution does not require the approval of Rajya Sabha. If 1/10 th of total Lok Sabha members submit a written notice to the Speaker (or to President when House is not in session), a special sitting to consider the resolution to revoke the emergency has to be held within 14 days. 44th Amd, 1978 introduced the power of the Lok Sabha to pass a resolution to revoke emergency. The provision for calling a special sitting within 14 days was also introduced through this amendment. Effects of National Emergency. Effects on Centre-State Relations : Executive : Centre gets powers to give directions to State Govts on any matter, unlike in normal times when directions can only be given on specific matters. Centre gains complete control of the State executive. Legislative : Parliament can make laws on all State subjects. These laws become inoperative after 6 months from the end of emergency. State Leg continue to exist with their powers of making laws on all State Subjects. Parliament can confer powers outside of Union List to Centre & its officers to implement laws made by Parl on State subjects during Emergency. Financial : President can modify Constitutional distribution of revenues between Centre & States. Prez can reduce or cancel the transfer of finances from centre to States. Such modification lasts until end of financial year. All such orders must be laid before both houses of Parliament. The exec & leg provs above even apply to States outside of emergency. Effect on the Life of the Lok Sabha & State Assembly : Parliament can extend the 5 year term of Lok Sabha by law upto 1 year at a time, for as long as the emergency lasts. Such an extension ceases to have effect beyond 6 months from the end of the emergency. Effect on the Fundamental Rights : Article 358 & Article 359. Suspension of Fund. Rts in Art 19 : Art 358 declares, all six rights in Art 19 are automatically suspended only during External Emergency. Laws & Exec action in violation of Six Rights, made during the emergency, cannot be challenged even after the emergency. Other exec/leg acts can be challenged. Suspension of other Fund. Rts : Art 359 empowers Prez to order the suspension of Right to approach the courts if any other Fund. Rts (except Art 20 & 21) are violated by executive or legislature. Such a violation cannot be challenged even after the emergency ends. This suspension is only applicable to those Rights specifically mentioned in the Prez Order. Its applicable to all parts of India. Parliamentary approval is necessary. President’s Rule. Grounds of Imposition. Art 355 imposes duty on Centre to ensure States follow the Constitution. Art 356 gives the power to Centre to impose President’s Rule on States if the States fail to follow the Constitution. Can be declared on 2 grounds mentioned in Art 356 & Art 365 respectively. Art 356 – If the Prez feels that the Govt of a State cannot be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. This can be done on the report of the State Governor, but also without it. Art 365 – If a state fails to comply or give effect to any direction given by the Centre in accordance to the Constitution, the Prez can hold that the State Govt is not being carried out in accordance to Constitution & impose President’s Rule. Parliamentary Approval & Duration. Proclamation must be approved by both houses of Parliament within 2 months by Simple Majority. The Parliament must reapprove the proclamation every six months for a maximum period of 3 years. If Lok Sabha is dissolved at the time of proclamation, only Rajya Sabha must approve it within 2 months. Lok Sabha must approve within 30 days of reconstitution. The same applies to the reapproval process every 6 months. Proclamation of President’s Rule can only extended beyond 1 year only if following conditions are met : If National Emergency is in effect in whole Country or in whole or part of the concerned State & If Election Commission certifies that Leg Assembly elections in the State cannot be held due to difficulties. President’s Rule can be revoked by Prez through Proclamation without Parliamentary Approval. Consequences of President’s Rule. President acquires following powers during President’s Rule : Prez can take up all functions of State govt, Governor & other exec body. Prez can give the powers of state legislature to the Parliament. Prez can all necessary steps, including suspension of Constitutional provisions relating to any body or authority in the state. CM & Council of Ministers are dismissed. State Governor, on behalf of Prez takes charge with the help of Chief Secretary & other advisors. State Leg is either suspended or dissolved. Parliament is put in charge : Parl. can give legislative powers to Prez or an authority appointed by him. Laws giving special powers to Centre or its officers can be made. Laws continue to be in effect even after the President’s Rule ends. When Lok Sabha is not in session, Prez can authorise expenditure from State Consolidated Fund, pending approval of Parliament. Prez can also issue Ordinance for State when Parl is not in session. Scope of Judicial Review. The original provision of the Constitution for the judicial review of the grounds of imposing President’s Rule was restored by 44th Amd Act, 1978. In Bommai case (1994), SC laid down following propositions : Satisfaction of President must be based on relevant material, the burden to prove the same lies on the Centre. The Court cannot go into the correctness or adequacy of the material, but it can see whether material is relevant or not. President’s Rule can be struck down if it is based on irrelevant or extraneous grounds or if it was found to be malafied or perverse. In such case, State Govt & Leg can be restored by the court. President can only suspend the State Leg without Parliamentary approval. Approval is required for dissolving the legislature. Anti-secular State Govt activities is a valid ground to activate Art 356. State Govt can be dismissed only after vote count in the lower House. Financial Emergency. Grounds of Declaration. Article 360 empowers President to declare Financial Emergency if he is satisfied that the financial stability or credit of India or any part of its Territory is threatened. 44th Amd, 1978 restored Judicial Review against the grounds on which a Financial Emergency is declared. Parliamentary Approval & Duration. Financial Emergency must be approved within 2 months of proclamation by both houses of Parliament by Simple Majority. If Lok Sabha remains dissolved at the time of proclamation, then only the Rajya Sabha is required to approve within 2 months. The Lok Sabha mus approve the Emergency within 30 days of reconstitution. Repeated Parliamentary Approval is not required. There is no maximum period prescribed for the emergency. Financial Emergency can be revoked by the President by a proclamation. Parliamentary approval is not required. Effects of Financial Emergency. Centre can direct States to observe such canons of financial propriety that it specifies. Centre’s executive authority extends to directions as the President may deem necessary & adequate for the purpose. Such directions may include provisions requiring reduction of salaries & allowances of any or all classes of State employees. Directions may also include for reservation of all money bills or other finance bills passed by State leg for consideration of President. President may issue directions for the reduction of salaries & allowances of all or any classes of Union employees. President may also issue directions for the reduction of salaries & allowances of the judges of Supreme Court & High Courts. Criticism of the Emergency Provisions. Federal Character of Constitution is destroyed and Union becomes all powerful. Powers of the State — Union & State powers — are concentrated with the Union Executive. Prime Minister, in the name of the President, achieves dictatorial powers. Financial Autonomy of the State is nullified. Fundamental Rights become meaningless and, as a result, the Democratic foundations of the Constitution is destroyed."

    "chapter": "Federal System",
    "content": "Introduction. Federal System – Powers of Central & Regional Govts are given by the Constitution. Unitary Govt – Only Central Govt powers are given by the Constitution. All other Govts derive their powers as dictated by the Central Govt. India is a ‘Union of States’ with a Stronger Centre. (Canada model) Term ‘Federation’ not mentioned in the Constitution. Federal System was adopted due to the large size of the Country & Socio-cultural diversity. Indian Constitution provides for a mix of Federal & Unitary features. Federal Features of the Constitution. Dual Polity : Separate independent Govts at Centre & States. Written Constitution : Powers of Centre & States clearly marked out in the form a written book. Division of Powers : Powers divided into Union (100 subjects) , State (61 subjects) & Concurrent (52 subjects) Lists. Supremacy of Constitution : All organs of Govt at Centre & States operate within jurisdiction provided by Const. Centre can’t step over States. Rigid Constitution : Provisions regarding Federal Structure of Country are difficult to amend, requiring Special Majority + Consent of States. Independent Judiciary : To protect & enforce Supremacy of Constitution. Bicameralism : Rajya Sabha is a permanent representation of States. Unitary Features of the Constitution. Strong Centre : Union List has more subjects, with more important subjects & overriding authority over Concurrent list. Residuary Powers lies with Centre. States Not Indestructible : Parliament can unilaterally, by simple majority, change the area, boundary & names of any State. Single Constitution : No separate Constitution for States (except J&K). Flexibility of the Constitution : Most provisions can be amended unilaterally by the Parliament through Simple or Special Majority. Emergency Provisions : During emergency, Centre becomes all powerful and the country functions as a Unitary structure. Single Citizenship : No Second Citizenship for domicile of States. Integrated Judiciary : Single system of Courts enforces both Central & State Laws. All-India Services : Officers recruited by Centre to work in States. Integrated Audit Machinery : Comptroller & Auditor-General of India is appointed by President but has powers to audit the accounts of both Centre & States. Parliament’s Authority over State Lists : Parl. can make laws on any Subject of the State List if Rajya Sabha passes a resolution in favour of doing so. Appointment of Governor : Appointed by President. Acts as an agent of Centre. Integrated Election Machinery : Members appointed by President. Conduct elections for entire country at Central & State levels. Veto over State Bills : Governor has right to reserve certain bills passed by State Legislature for the consideration of the President.

    "chapter": "Parliamentary System",
    "content": "Introduction. Constitution provides for a Parliamentary form of Govt at Centre & States. Art 74 & 75 – deal with Central Parliamentary System. Art 163 & 164 – deal with States’ Parliamentary System. In opposition to Presidential form – executive not responsible to legislature. Parliamentary form – executive is directly responsible to the legislature. Borrowed from Britain – Westminster Model of Govt. Features of Parliamentary Government. Nominal & Real Executives : President is only nominal exec with the PM & Council of Ministers as Real Exec. Advice of CoM is binding on President. Majority Party Rule : Politics Party with majority in Lok Sabha forms Govt & Prez appoints its leader as PM. Other ministers are appointed by Prez on binding advice of PM. However, Prez has discretion to choose anyone as PM. Collective Responsibility : CoM are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general & Lok Sabha in particular (Art 75). Lok Sabha can dismiss entire Ministry by passing Vote of No Confidence. Political Homogeneity : CoM share same political ideology belonging to same political party or are bound by consensus in coalition. Double Membership : CoM hold membership leg & exec. Any Minister who is not an MP for a period longer than 6 months ceases to be a minister. Leadership of the PM : PM is leader of CoM, Parliament & Majority Party. Dissolution of the Lower House : Exec enjoys right to dissolve leg. Prez dissolves leg on advice of PM before elections. Secrecy : Ministers cannot divulge info on CoM proceedings, policies & decisions. Prez administers the oath of secrecy. Features of Presidential Government. Prez is both head of State & of Govt (Real executive). No nominal executive. Prez cannot be removed by legislature, except through impeachment proceedings. President’s Cabinet is only an advisory body. Their advise is not binding. Prez & his Secretaries (members of cabinet) are not responsible to the legislature and are not members of the Legislature. Secretaries are nominated on complete discretion by the President. President cannot dissolve the lower House. All three wings of Govt – legislature, executive & Judiciary – are separated from each other and function independently. Merits of Parliamentary System. Harmony between Leg & Exec : Less scope for disputes as exec are part of leg. Responsible Govt : Representatives of People (MPs) are directly able to check the Govt. Prevents despotism : Exec is directly responsible to Parliament & can be dismissed by them. Ready Alternative Govt : When ruling party loses majority, opposition can be invited to form Govt, hence a fresh election need not be held. Wide Representation : Ministers are representatives of different constituencies from different parts of India, therefore allowing wide representation of opinions from representatives from different places. Demerits of Parliamentary System. Unstable Govt : Govts have no guarantee of tenure and are at the mercy of party legislators in majority. A no-confidence motion or political defection or evils of multiparty system could bring the Govt down. No Continuity of Policies : Policies change with Govts, with unstable Govts policy changes can be far too frequent within short periods of time. Dictatorship of Cabinet : When ruling party has absolute majority, its leaders in Cabinet become dictatorial & autocratic. Against Separation of Powers : Cabinet acts as leader of leg & Exec, allowing no checks & balances on their powers. Govt by Amateurs : PM limited to appointment of Ministers from either houses of Parliament. No non-political expert can be appointed. Reasons for Adopting Parliamentary System Familiarity with System before independence. Constituent Assembly gave preference to a Responsible Govt. Need to avoid Leg-Exec disputes. Diversity of India required wider representation in Govt. Distinction between Indian & British Models of Govt India has Republican system instead of a Monarchy. Parliament is not sovereign as we have India has Written Constitution. In India PM can be member of either House of Parl. British PM can only be from the Lower House. Indian Ministers can be appointed for a max period of six months even if they are not MPs. British Ministers are always MPs. Indian ministers do not countersign the orders of the Head of State (Prez). British Ministers countersign orders of the monarch. British Parl has ‘Shadow Cabinet’ formed of Members of Opposition. India has no Shadow Cabinet."

    "chapter": "Amendment Of The Constitution",
    "content": "Introduction. Constitution is Partly Rigid & Partly Flexible. Art 368 of Part XX deals with Amendment. Parliament has sole power to amend by addition, variation or repeal. SC (Keshavnanda Bharti case, 1973) provided for ‘Basic Structure of the Constitution’ – all provisions declared as ‘basic structure’ cannot be amended. Procedure for Amendment through Art 368. Introduction of Bill by any member in either House of Parliament only. Must be passed in each House by a Special Majority – majority of total membership & ⅔ of members voting. No provision for Joint Sitting. If Bill seeks to amend federal provisions, Bill must be Ratified by half of the State Legislatures with a simple majority. President’s assent is obligatory. President cannot return or reject Bill. After assent the Bill becomes an Act & the Constitution stands amended. Types of Amendment. Art 368 only provides for two methods of Amendment – Special Majority of Parliament & Special Majority + Consent of States. Some other Articles provide for amendment through Simple Majority alone. Simple Majority : Outside of Art 368. Requires over 50 % of members present & voting. Provisions include – Admission or Estab of new States/formation of new States, alteration of their boundaries or names/Abolition or creation of Leg Councils/2nd Sch – salary & perks of Prez, Govs, judges, etc./Quorum in Parliament/Salaries & allowances of MPs/Rules of Prc of Parl/Privileges of Parliament/Use of English Language in Parl/Number of puisne Judges in SC/increase of SC jurisdiction/Citizenship acquisition & termination/Elections to Parliament & State Leg/Delimitation of Constituencies/Union Territories/5th Sch – admin of Sch Areas & Tribes/6th Sch – admin of tribal areas.

Includes Provisions of Election of the President & its manner;Extent of exec powers of the Union & States; Supreme Court & High Courts; Distribution of leg powers (Subjects) between Union & States; any lists in 7th Schedule: Representation of States in Parliament; Art 368 itself. Criticism of the Amendment Procedure. No provision for a special body for amendment of Constitution like Constitutional Convention (as in USA). Parliament is all powerful. Power to initiate amendments lies with Parl. (exception in creation/abolition of State Legislative Council – here too Parl can reject the proposal). Major part can be amended by Parl alone without State consent. No time frame for States to ratify Amendments, no clarification if consent given to the amendment can be withdrawn later. No provision for Joint Sitting of both houses of Parliament. Most amendments are passed by Simple Majority. Amendment Procedure is not crystal clear, leave room for judicial intervention."

    "content": "Introduction. Enumerated in Part-lV of the Constitution – Article 36-51. Article 36 deals the definition of State in Context of DPSP.

Art 37 – declares DPSP fundamental in gov of country & it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in the making of laws & policies. Helps in determining the Constitutional validity of a law. SC has ruled that if a law seeks to give effect to a Directive Principle, then that law may be considered to be ‘reasonable’ in relation to Art 14 or Art 19. Fundamental Rights enjoy Supremacy however they can be amended in order to implement Directive Principles without affecting the Basic Structure of the Constitution. Classification of the Directive Principles. Socialistic Principles : (lay path towards Welfare State) Art 38 : Promote welfare by securing social order permeated by justice – social, economic & political / minimise inequalities in income, status, facilities & opportunities-44th Amd, 1978.

Illogically arranged : no classification, no consistency with the more unimportant principles mixed up with the important & fund. principles. Conservative : based on 19th century philosophy. Not suitable for the 21st century challenges & issues. Constitutional Conflict : (a) Centre & States – Centre can give order to States to implement DPSP, & can dismiss state govt if they fail to comply. (b) President & Prime Minister – President may reject bills passed by Parliament on the excuse that it violates DPSP. (c) Governor & States – Governor may also reject bill passed by State Govt if they violate DPSP. Directive Principles outside of Part-lV.
